Started in hybrid online/batch training mode.
Data fractions (40 sequences each) will be shuffled during training.
Sequences will be shuffled within and across data fractions during training.
The trained network will be written to 'exp\blstmtagwer.i.t1\model\network_train.jsn'.
Validation error will be calculated every 1 epochs.
Test error will be calculated every 1 epochs.
Training will be stopped after 1000 epochs or if there is no new lowest validation error within 10 epochs.
Utilizing the GPU for computations with 40 sequences in parallel.
