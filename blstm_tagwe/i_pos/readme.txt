# Workspace guide

---------------

This is the experimental workspace of BLSTM-RNN based Part-of-Speech tagging approach.

To run the experiment, the following softwares and packages must be installed:  
* Python (2.7.6, 32bit)
* Python package: numpy (1.8.1, win32, for python2.7), http://www.numpy.org/
* Python package: netCDF (1.0.9, win32, for python2.7), https://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/

Detailed information of the software we used is listed in the parenthesis.
Higher version should work but is not tested. 

After installing all the required softwares and packages, 
type cmd:
python blstmpos.i.t1.py
to run the whole POS tagging experiment.

type cmd:
python blstmposwe.i.t1.py
to run the whole POS tagging with word embedding experiment.
