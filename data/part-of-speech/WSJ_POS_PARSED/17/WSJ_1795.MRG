The/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP System/NNP is/VBZ the/DT standard/JJ object/NN of/IN suggestions/NNS for/IN organizational/JJ and/CC institutional/JJ changes/NNS ,/, for/IN two/CD reasons/NNS ./.
First/JJ ,/, its/PRP$ position/NN in/IN the/DT government/NN is/VBZ anomalous/JJ ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ an/DT unusual/JJ kind/NN of/IN independence/NN from/IN elected/VBN officials/NNS and/CC still/RB has/VBZ authority/NN over/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS powerful/JJ of/IN government/NN 's/POS instruments/NNS --/: the/DT control/NN of/IN the/DT money/NN supply/NN ./.
Thus/RB we/PRP have/VBP a/DT condition/NN that/WDT *T*-2/-NONE- is/VBZ easily/RB described/VBN *-1/-NONE- as/IN undemocratic/JJ ./.
Second/JJ ,/, the/DT responsibilities/NNS of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP as/IN guardian/NN of/IN the/DT currency/NN ,/, which/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- means/VBZ as/IN guardian/NN of/IN the/DT stability/NN of/IN the/DT price/NN level/NN ,/, sometimes/RB lead/VBP it/PRP to/TO take/VB measures/NNS that/WDT *T*-2/-NONE- are/VBP unpopular/JJ ./.
As/IN former/JJ Fed/NNP Chairman/NNP William/NNP McChesney/NNP Martin/NNP used/VBD *-1/-NONE- to/TO say/VB ,/, they/PRP would/MD have/VB *-2/-NONE- to/TO take/VB the/DT punch/NN bowl/NN away/RB just/RB as/IN the/DT party/NN is/VBZ getting/VBG interesting/JJ ./.
So/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP is/VBZ an/DT attractive/JJ target/NN for/IN complaint/NN by/IN politicians/NNS ./.
The/DT Fed/NNP is/VBZ easily/RB assigned/VBN *-1/-NONE- the/DT blame/NN for/IN unpleasantness/NN ,/, like/IN high/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS or/CC slow/JJ economic/JJ growth/NN ,/, while/IN the/DT politicians/NNS can/MD escape/VB responsibility/NN by/IN *-2/-NONE- pointing/VBG to/TO the/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS independence/NN ./.
This/DT leads/VBZ to/TO proposals/NNS for/IN ``/`` reform/NN ''/'' of/IN the/DT Fed/NNP ,/, which/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- have/VBP the/DT common/JJ feature/NN of/IN */-NONE- making/VBG the/DT Fed/NNP more/RBR responsive/JJ to/TO the/DT administration/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT Congress/NNP and/CC to/TO public/JJ opinion/NN --/: without/IN ,/, however/RB ,/, any/DT assumption/NN of/IN additional/JJ responsibility/NN by/IN the/DT politicians/NNS ./.
These/DT proposals/NNS include/VBP */-NONE- changing/VBG the/DT term/NN of/IN the/DT chairman/NN ,/, shortening/VBG the/DT terms/NNS of/IN the/DT members/NNS ,/, eliminating/VBG the/DT presidents/NNS of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP Banks/NNPS from/IN the/DT decision-making/JJ process/NN ,/, putting/VBG the/DT Secretary/NNP of/IN the/DT Treasury/NNP on/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP Board/NNP ,/, having/VBG the/DT Fed/NNP audited/VBD *-1/-NONE- by/IN an/DT arm/NN of/IN Congress/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- the/DT General/NNP Accounting/NNP Office/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, putting/VBG the/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS expenditures/NNS in/IN the/DT budget/NN ,/, and/CC requiring/VBG prompt/JJ publication/NN of/IN the/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS minutes/NNS ./.
Some/DT of/IN these/DT ideas/NNS are/VBP again/RB under/IN consideration/NN in/IN Congress/NNP ./.
But/CC these/DT proposals/NNS do/VBP not/RB rest/VB on/IN a/DT view/NN of/IN what/WP the/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS problem/NN is/VBZ *T*-1/-NONE- or/CC ,/, if/IN they/PRP do/VBP *?*/-NONE- ,/, they/PRP rest/VBP on/IN an/DT incorrect/JJ view/NN ./.
They/PRP would/MD not/RB solve/VB the/DT problem/NN ;/: they/PRP would/MD make/VB it/PRP worse/JJR ./.
The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/IN the/DT Fed/NNP is/VBZ too/RB unresponsive/JJ to/TO the/DT public/JJ interest/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB responsive/JJ to/TO an/DT incorrect/JJ view/NN of/IN the/DT public/JJ interest/NN ./.
The/DT price/NN level/NN in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP is/VBZ now/RB about/IN 4/CD 1$$4/CD times/NNS as/RB high/RB as/IN it/PRP was/VBD *?*/-NONE- 30/CD years/NNS ago/IN ./.
On/IN average/NN ,/, something/NN that/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- cost/VBD $/$ 100/CD *U*/-NONE- 30/CD years/NNS ago/IN now/RB costs/VBZ $/$ 425/CD *U*/-NONE- ./.
Or/CC ,/, a/DT wage/NN that/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- was/VBD $/$ 100/CD *U*/-NONE- 30/CD years/NNS ago/IN would/MD buy/VB only/RB $/$ 23.53/CD *U*/-NONE- worth/NN of/IN stuff/NN today/NN ./.
On/IN two/CD occasions/NNS the/DT inflation/NN rate/NN rose/VBD to/TO more/JJR than/IN 10/CD %/NN a/DT year/NN ./.
In/IN each/DT case/NN the/DT ending/NN of/IN this/DT unsustainable/JJ inflation/NN caused/VBD a/DT severe/JJ recession/NN --/: the/DT two/CD worst/JJS of/IN the/DT postwar/JJ period/NN ./.
The/DT enormous/JJ inflation/NN over/IN the/DT past/JJ 30/CD years/NNS was/VBD largely/RB due/JJ to/TO monetary/JJ policy/NN ./.
At/IN least/JJS ,/, it/PRP would/MD not/RB have/VB happened/VBN without/IN the/DT support/NN of/IN monetary/JJ policy/NN that/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- provided/VBD for/IN a/DT 10-fold/JJ increase/NN in/IN the/DT money/NN supply/NN during/IN the/DT same/JJ period/NN ./.
And/CC that/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT money/NN supply/NN would/MD not/RB have/VB happened/VBN without/IN the/DT consent/NN of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP ./.
The/DT basic/JJ problem/NN of/IN monetary/JJ policy/NN ,/, to/TO which/WDT reform/NN of/IN the/DT Fed/NNP should/MD be/VB addressed/VBN *-1/-NONE- *T*-2/-NONE- ,/, is/VBZ */-NONE- to/TO prevent/VB a/DT recurrence/NN of/IN this/DT experience/NN ./.
There/EX were/VBD two/CD general/JJ reasons/NNS for/IN the/DT mistaken/JJ monetary/JJ policy/NN of/IN the/DT past/JJ 30/CD years/NNS :/:
1/CD ./. To/TO some/DT extent/NN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP shared/VBD the/DT popular/JJ but/CC incorrect/JJ view/NN that/IN expansionary/JJ monetary/JJ policy/NN could/MD yield/VB a/DT net/JJ improvement/NN in/IN employment/NN and/CC output/NN ./.
2/CD ./. Even/RB where/WRB the/DT Fed/NNP did/VBD not/RB share/VB this/DT view/NN *T*-1/-NONE- it/PRP felt/VBD the/DT need/NN */-NONE- to/TO accommodate/VB to/TO it/PRP ./.
Despite/IN all/PDT the/DT formal/JJ provisions/NNS for/IN its/PRP$ independence/NN ,/, the/DT Fed/NNP seems/VBZ constantly/RB *-1/-NONE- to/TO feel/VB that/IN if/IN it/PRP uses/VBZ its/PRP$ independence/NN too/RB freely/RB it/PRP will/MD lose/VB it/PRP ./.
The/DT common/JJ proposals/NNS for/IN */-NONE- reforming/VBG the/DT Fed/NNP would/MD only/RB make/VB the/DT situation/NN worse/JJR ,/, if/IN they/PRP had/VBD any/DT effect/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
*/-NONE- Putting/VBG the/DT Secretary/NNP of/IN the/DT Treasury/NNP on/IN the/DT Board/NNP of/IN Governors/NNP ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT leading/VBG proposals/NNS today/NN ,/, is/VBZ an/DT example/NN ./.
The/DT secretary/NN is/VBZ the/DT world/NN 's/POS biggest/JJS borrower/NN of/IN money/NN ./.
He/PRP has/VBZ a/DT built-in/NN ,/, constant/JJ longing/NN for/IN lower/JJR interest/NN rates/NNS ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, he/PRP is/VBZ a/DT political/JJ agent/NN of/IN a/DT political/JJ president/NN ,/, who/WP *T*-1/-NONE- naturally/RB gives/VBZ extraordinary/JJ weight/NN to/TO the/DT way/NN 0/-NONE- the/DT economy/NN will/MD perform/VB before/IN the/DT next/JJ election/NN *T*-2/-NONE- ,/, and/CC less/JJR to/TO its/PRP$ longer-run/JJ health/NN ./.
These/DT days/NNS ,/, the/DT secretary/NN suffers/VBZ the/DT further/JJ disqualification/NN that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ a/DT member/NN of/IN a/DT club/NN of/IN seven/CD finance/NN ministers/NNS who/WP *T*-1/-NONE- meet/VBP occasionally/RB *-4/-NONE- to/TO decide/VB what/WP exchange/NN rates/NNS should/MD be/VB *T*-3/-NONE- ,/, which/WDT *T*-2/-NONE- is/VBZ a/DT diversion/NN from/IN the/DT real/JJ business/NN *ICH*-5/-NONE- of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP */-NONE- to/TO stabilize/VB the/DT price/NN level/NN ./.
How/WRB should/MD a/DT reasonable/JJ member/NN of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP Board/NNP interpret/VB a/DT congressional/JJ decision/NN */-NONE- to/TO put/VB the/DT secretary/NN on/IN the/DT board/NN *T*-1/-NONE- ?/.
Could/MD he/PRP plausibly/RB interpret/VB it/PRP as/IN encouragement/NN for/IN the/DT Fed/NNP to/TO give/VB primary/JJ emphasis/NN to/TO */-NONE- stabilizing/VBG the/DT price/NN level/NN ?/.
Or/CC would/MD he/PRP interpret/VB it/PRP as/IN instruction/NN */-NONE- to/TO give/VB more/JJR weight/NN to/TO these/DT other/JJ objectives/NNS that/IN the/DT secretary/NN represents/VBZ *T*-1/-NONE- --/: low/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS ,/, short-run/JJ economic/JJ expansion/NN ,/, and/CC stabilization/NN of/IN exchange/NN rates/NNS at/IN internationally/RB managed/VBN levels/NNS ?/.
The/DT answer/NN seems/VBZ perfectly/RB clear/JJ ./.
-LRB-/-LRB- True/JJ ,/, a/DT succession/NN of/IN Fed/NNP chairmen/NNS has/VBZ given/VBN color/NN to/TO the/DT notion/NN that/IN the/DT Secretary/NNP of/IN the/DT Treasury/NNP belongs/VBZ on/IN the/DT Fed/NNP ./.
By/IN their/PRP$ constant/JJ readiness/NN */-NONE- to/TO advise/VB all/DT and/CC sundry/JJ about/IN federal/JJ budgetary/JJ matters/NNS the/DT chairmen/NNS have/VBP encouraged/VBN the/DT belief/NN that/DT fiscal/JJ policy/NN and/CC monetary/JJ policy/NN are/VBP ingredients/NNS of/IN a/DT common/JJ stew/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT case/NN it/PRP *EXP*-2/-NONE- is/VBZ natural/JJ that/IN the/DT Fed/NNP and/CC the/DT Treasury/NNP ,/, and/CC probably/RB also/RB the/DT Congress/NNP ,/, should/MD be/VB jointly/RB engaged/VBN *-1/-NONE- in/IN */-NONE- stirring/VBG the/DT pot/NN *T*-3/-NONE- ./.

The/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS problem/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB independent/JJ ,/, or/CC too/RB unpolitical/JJ ./.
The/DT Fed/NNP is/VBZ responsive/JJ to/TO *RNR*-1/-NONE- ,/, and/CC can/MD not/RB help/VB *-2/-NONE- being/VBG responsive/JJ to/TO *RNR*-1/-NONE- ,/, the/DT more/JJR overtly/RB political/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT government/NN ./.
