*/-NONE- Regarding/VBG the/DT Oct./NNP 3/CD letter/NN to/TO the/DT editor/NN from/IN Rep./NNP Tom/NNP Lantos/NNP ,/, chairman/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP Subcommittee/NNP on/IN Employment/NNP and/CC Housing/NNP ,/, alleging/VBG :/:
1/LS ./. That/IN your/PRP$ Sept./NNP 28/CD editorial/NN ``/`` Kangaroo/NN Committees/NNS ''/'' was/VBD factually/RB inaccurate/JJ and/CC deliberately/RB misleading/JJ ./.
I/PRP thought/VBD 0/-NONE- your/PRP$ editorial/NN was/VBD factually/RB accurate/JJ and/CC deliberately/RB elucidative/JJ ./.

Yes/UH ,/, he/PRP did/VBD ./.
As/IN I/PRP watched/VBD him/PRP on/IN C-Span/NNP ,/, I/PRP heard/VBD 0/-NONE- him/PRP speak/VB those/DT lovely/JJ words/NNS about/IN the/DT Bill/NNP of/IN Rights/NNPS ,/, which/WDT he/PRP quotes/VBZ *T*-1/-NONE- from/IN the/DT transcript/NN of/IN the/DT hearings/NNS ./.
He/PRP did/VBD repeat/VB those/DT nice/JJ platitudes/NNS several/JJ times/NNS as/IN an/DT indication/NN of/IN his/PRP$ support/NN for/IN the/DT Constitution/NNP ./.
He/PRP used/VBD about/RB 56/CD words/NNS *-1/-NONE- defending/VBG the/DT witnesses/NNS '/POS constitutional/JJ rights/NNS ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, by/IN my/PRP$ rough/JJ guess/NN ,/, he/PRP used/VBD better/JJR than/IN 5,000/CD words/NNS *-1/-NONE- heaping/VBG scorn/NN on/IN the/DT witnesses/NNS for/IN *-2/-NONE- exercising/VBG the/DT Fifth/NNP ./.
He/PRP sandwiched/VBD his/PRP$ praise/NN of/IN constitutional/JJ meat/NN between/IN large/JJ loaves/NNS of/IN bilious/JJ commentary/NN ./.
As/IN your/PRP$ editorial/NN rightly/RB pointed/VBD out/RP ,/, Samuel/NNP Pierce/NNP ,/, former/JJ HUD/NNP secretary/NN ,/, and/CC Lance/NNP Wilson/NNP ,/, Mr./NNP Pierce/NNP 's/POS former/JJ aide/NN ,/, ``/`` are/VBP currently/RB being/VBG held/VBD *-1/-NONE- up/RB to/TO scorn/NN for/IN *-1/-NONE- taking/VBG the/DT Fifth/NNP Amendment/NNP ./.
''/'' That/DT certainly/RB is/VBZ not/RB the/DT supposed/JJ ``/`` distorted/JJ reading/NN ''/'' indicated/VBN */-NONE- by/IN Mr./NNP Lantos/NNP ./.
3/LS ./. That/IN his/PRP$ ``/`` committee/NN does/VBZ not/RB deal/VB with/IN any/DT possible/JJ criminal/JJ activity/NN at/IN HUD/NNP ./.
My/PRP$ colleagues/NNS and/CC I/PRP fully/RB realize/VBP 0/-NONE- we/PRP are/VBP not/RB a/DT court/NN .../: etc/FW ./. ''/''
Absolute/JJ rubbish/NN ./.
By/IN any/DT ``/`` reasonable/JJ man/NN ''/'' criterion/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Lantos/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ colleagues/NNS have/VBP a/DT whole/JJ bunch/NN of/IN people/NNS tried/VBN and/CC convicted/VBN ./.
Apparently/RB ,/, their/PRP$ verdict/NN is/VBZ in/RB ./.

That/DT 's/VBZ not/RB a/DT bad/JJ way/NN 0/-NONE- */-NONE- to/TO proceed/VB *T*-1/-NONE- ,/, just/RB somewhat/RB different/JJ from/IN standard/JJ American/JJ practice/NN ./.

Ah/UH ,/, yes/UH ,/, something/NN called/VBN */-NONE- a/DT Star/NNP Chamber/NNP ./.
Of/IN course/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Lantos/NNP doth/VBZ protest/NN that/IN his/PRP$ subcommittee/NN simply/RB seeks/VBZ information/NN for/IN legislative/JJ change/NN ./.
No/DT doubt/NN 0/-NONE- that/WDT 's/VBZ partially/RB true/JJ ./.
Everything/NN that/IN Mr./NNP Lantos/NNP says/VBZ *T*-1/-NONE- in/IN his/PRP$ letter/NN is/VBZ partially/RB true/JJ ./.

But/CC if/IN his/PRP$ explanation/NN of/IN motivation/NN is/VBZ true/JJ ,/, why/WRB is/VBZ his/PRP$ investigation/NN so/RB oriented/VBN *-2/-NONE- as/IN *-2/-NONE- to/TO identify/VB criminal/JJ activity/NN *T*-1/-NONE- ?/.

No/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Lantos/NNP 's/POS complaints/NNS simply/RB wo/MD n't/RB wash/VB ./.
4/LS ./. That/IN the/DT Journal/NNP defends/VBZ ``/`` the/DT sleaze/NN ,/, fraud/NN ,/, waste/NN ,/, embezzlement/NN ,/, influence-peddling/NN and/CC abuse/NN of/IN the/DT public/NN that/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- took/VBD place/NN while/IN Mr./NNP Pierce/NNP was/VBD secretary/NN of/IN HUD/NNP ,/, ''/'' etc./FW and/CC so/RB forth/RB ./.
No/UH ,/, to/TO my/PRP$ mind/NN ,/, the/DT Journal/NNP did/VBD not/RB ``/`` defend/VB sleaze/NN ,/, fraud/NN ,/, waste/NN ,/, embezzlement/NN ,/, influence-peddling/NN and/CC abuse/NN of/IN the/DT public/JJ trust/NN .../: ''/''
it/PRP defended/VBD appropriate/JJ constitutional/JJ safeguards/NNS and/CC practical/JJ common/JJ sense/NN ./.
The/DT problem/NN ,/, which/WDT the/DT Journal/NNP so/RB rightly/RB pointed/VBN *T*-1/-NONE- out/RP in/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN articles/NNS ,/, is/VBZ not/RB the/DT likes/NNS of/IN Mr./NNP Lantos/NNP ,/, who/WP *T*-2/-NONE- after/IN all/DT is/VBZ really/RB a/DT bit/JJ player/NN on/IN the/DT stage/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT attempt/NN *ICH*-3/-NONE- by/IN Congress/NNP */-NONE- to/TO enhance/VB itself/PRP into/IN a/DT quasi-parliamentary$$judicial/JJ body/NN ./.
-LRB-/-LRB- Of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP 've/VBP also/RB got/VBN a/DT judiciary/NN that/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- seeks/VBZ the/DT same/JJ objective/NN ./. -RRB-/-RRB-
The/DT system/NN is/VBZ the/DT problem/NN ,/, not/RB an/DT individual/JJ member/NN ./.
Individuals/NNS can/MD always/RB have/VB their/PRP$ hands/NNS slapped/VBN *-1/-NONE- ./.
It/PRP 's/POS when/WRB such/JJ slapping/NN does/VBZ n't/RB occur/VB *T*-1/-NONE- that/IN we/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN trouble/NN *T*-2/-NONE- ./.
I/PRP do/VBP not/RB by/IN any/DT means/NNS defend/VB HUD/NNP management/NN ./.
But/CC I/PRP think/VBP 0/-NONE- the/DT kind/NN of/IN congressional/JJ investigation/NN that/WDT *T*-2/-NONE- has/VBZ been/VBN pursued/VBN *-1/-NONE- is/VBZ a/DT far/RB greater/JJR danger/NN to/TO American/JJ notions/NNS of/IN liberty/NN and/CC freedom/NN than/IN any/DT incompetency/NN -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC ,/, yes/UH ,/, maybe/RB criminality/NN -RRB-/-RRB- within/IN HUD/NNP could/MD possibly/RB generate/VB *?*/-NONE- ./.
The/DT last/JJ time/NN 0/-NONE- I/PRP saw/VBD a/DT similar/JJ congressional/JJ hearing/NN *T*-1/-NONE- was/VBD when/WRB ``/`` Tail/NNP Gunner/NNP Joe/NNP ''/'' McCarthy/NNP did/VBD his/PRP$ work/NN *T*-2/-NONE- ./.
Raymond/NNP Weber/NNP
Parsippany/NNP ,/, N.J/NNP ./.
I/PRP disagree/VBP with/IN the/DT statement/NN *ICH*-2/-NONE- by/IN Mr./NNP Lantos/NNP that/IN one/PRP should/MD not/RB draw/VB an/DT adverse/JJ inference/NN against/IN former/JJ HUD/NNP officials/NNS who/WP *T*-1/-NONE- assert/VBP their/PRP$ Fifth/NNP Amendment/NNP privilege/NN against/IN self-incrimination/NN in/IN congressional/JJ hearings/NNS ./.
The/DT Fifth/NNP Amendment/NNP states/VBZ in/IN relevant/JJ part/NN that/IN no/DT person/NN ``/`` shall/MD be/VB compelled/VBN ,/, in/IN any/DT criminal/JJ case/NN ,/, *-1/-NONE- to/TO be/VB a/DT witness/NN against/IN himself/PRP ./. ''/''
This/DT privilege/NN against/IN self-incrimination/NN precludes/VBZ the/DT drawing/NN of/IN an/DT adverse/JJ inference/NN against/IN a/DT criminal/JJ defendant/NN who/WP *T*-3/-NONE- chooses/VBZ not/RB *-1/-NONE- to/TO testify/VB ./.
Thus/RB ,/, in/IN a/DT criminal/JJ case/NN ,/, a/DT prosecutor/NN can/MD not/RB comment/VB on/IN a/DT defendant/NN 's/POS failure/NN */-NONE- to/TO testify/VB nor/CC can/MD the/DT defendant/NN be/VB compelled/VBN *-1/-NONE- to/TO take/VB the/DT stand/NN as/IN a/DT witness/NN ,/, thus/RB */-NONE- forcing/VBG him/PRP to/TO ``/`` take/VB the/DT Fifth/NNP ./. ''/''
The/DT privilege/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN limited/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN its/PRP$ plain/JJ language/NN *-1/-NONE- to/TO protect/VB the/DT defendant/NN in/IN criminal/JJ matters/NNS only/RB ./.
The/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP and/CC some/DT states/NNS have/VBP specifically/RB recognized/VBN that/IN ``/`` the/DT Fifth/NNP Amendment/NNP does/VBZ not/RB preclude/VB the/DT inference/NN where/WRB the/DT privilege/NN is/VBZ claimed/VBN *-1/-NONE- by/IN a/DT party/NN to/TO a/DT civil/JJ cause/NN *T*-2/-NONE- ./.

Baxter/NNP v./IN Palmingiano/NNP ,/, 425/CD U.S./NNP 308/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 1976/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
Thus/RB ,/, in/IN a/DT civil/JJ case/NN ,/, a/DT defendant/NN may/MD be/VB called/VBN *-1/-NONE- as/IN a/DT witness/NN ,/, he/PRP may/MD be/VB forced/VBN *-2/-NONE- to/TO testify/VB or/CC take/VB the/DT Fifth/NNP ,/, and/CC his/PRP$ taking/NN of/IN the/DT Fifth/NNP may/MD permit/VB the/DT drawing/NN of/IN an/DT adverse/JJ inference/NN against/IN him/PRP in/IN the/DT civil/JJ matter/NN ./.
He/PRP may/MD take/VB the/DT Fifth/NNP in/IN a/DT civil/JJ matter/NN only/RB if/IN he/PRP has/VBZ a/DT good/JJ faith/NN *EXP*-1/-NONE- and/CC justifiable/JJ belief/NN *EXP*-1/-NONE- that/IN his/PRP$ testimony/NN may/MD subject/VB him/PRP to/TO criminal/JJ prosecution/NN ./.
*/-NONE- Allowing/VBG the/DT defendant/NN to/TO take/VB the/DT Fifth/NNP in/IN a/DT civil/JJ matter/NN is/VBZ not/RB based/VBN *-2/-NONE- on/IN a/DT constitutional/JJ right/NN */-NONE- to/TO refuse/VB *-3/-NONE- to/TO testify/VB where/WRB one/PRP 's/POS testimony/NN harms/VBZ him/PRP in/IN the/DT civil/JJ matter/NN *T*-4/-NONE- ,/, but/CC because/IN the/DT testimony/NN in/IN the/DT civil/JJ matter/NN could/MD be/VB unconstitutionally/RB used/VBN *-1/-NONE- against/IN him/PRP in/IN a/DT subsequent/JJ criminal/JJ prosecution/NN ./.
Absent/JJ the/DT risk/NN of/IN such/JJ prosecution/NN ,/, a/DT court/NN may/MD order/VB the/DT defendant/NN *-1/-NONE- to/TO testify/VB ./.
Thus/RB ,/, when/WRB Mr./NNP Pierce/NNP asserted/VBD the/DT Fifth/NNP in/IN a/DT noncriminal/JJ proceeding/NN ,/, particularly/RB after/IN *-2/-NONE- presumably/RB receiving/VBG extensive/JJ advice/NN from/IN legal/JJ counsel/NN *T*-3/-NONE- ,/, one/PRP must/MD conclude/VB that/IN he/PRP held/VBD a/DT good-faith/NN ,/, justifiable/JJ belief/NN that/IN his/PRP$ testimony/NN could/MD be/VB used/VBN *-1/-NONE- against/IN him/PRP in/IN a/DT subsequent/JJ criminal/JJ prosecution/NN ./.
The/DT subcommittee/NN ,/, Congress/NNP and/CC the/DT American/JJ public/NN have/VBP every/DT right/NN */-NONE- to/TO draw/VB the/DT adverse/JJ inference/NN and/CC to/TO concur/VB with/IN Mr./NNP Pierce/NNP 's/POS own/JJ belief/NN that/IN his/PRP$ testimony/NN could/MD help/VB *-1/-NONE- convict/VB him/PRP of/IN a/DT crime/NN ./.
*/-NONE- Drawing/VBG the/DT adverse/JJ inference/NN in/IN a/DT noncriminal/JJ congressional/JJ hearing/NN does/VBZ not/RB offend/VB the/DT Fifth/NNP Amendment/NNP shield/NN against/IN self-incrimination/NN ./.
