In/IN either/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT investor/NN faces/VBZ three/CD possible/JJ outcomes/NNS :/:

The/DT worst-case/JJ scenario/NN would/MD be/VB if/IN the/DT put/NN expires/VBZ *-1/-NONE- worthless/JJ ./.
--/: If/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN the/DT stock/NN declines/VBZ ,/, the/DT put/NN will/MD increase/VB in/IN value/NN ./.
Once/IN the/DT stock/NN price/NN is/VBZ less/JJR than/IN the/DT exercise/NN price/NN ,/, or/CC ``/`` strike/NN price/NN ,/, ''/'' of/IN the/DT put/NN ,/, the/DT gain/NN will/MD match/VB the/DT loss/NN on/IN the/DT stock/NN dollar/NN for/IN dollar/NN ./.
The/DT put/NN establishes/VBZ a/DT minimum/NN selling/NN price/NN for/IN the/DT stock/NN during/IN its/PRP$ life/NN ./.
When/WRB a/DT stock/NN falls/VBZ below/IN the/DT put/NN 's/POS strike/NN price/NN *T*-1/-NONE- ,/, the/DT investor/NN simply/RB sells/VBZ the/DT stock/NN at/IN a/DT loss/NN and/CC simultaneously/RB sells/VBZ the/DT put/NN at/IN a/DT profit/NN ./.
Or/CC ,/, the/DT investor/NN can/MD exercise/VB the/DT put/NN ,/, by/IN *-2/-NONE- tendering/VBG the/DT stock/NN to/TO his/PRP$ or/CC her/PRP$ broker/NN in/IN return/NN for/IN payment/NN from/IN another/DT investor/NN who/WP *T*-1/-NONE- has/VBZ sold/VBN a/DT put/NN on/IN the/DT same/JJ stock/NN ./.
Brokers/NNS handle/VBP such/JJ transactions/NNS through/IN the/DT Options/NNP Clearing/NNP Corp./NNP ,/, which/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- guarantees/VBZ all/DT option/NN trades/NNS ./.
The/DT accompanying/JJ table/NN shows/VBZ how/WRB this/DT strategy/NN would/MD work/VB for/IN three/CD stocks/NNS *T*-1/-NONE- ./.
Though/IN */-NONE- not/RB reflected/VBN *-3/-NONE- in/IN the/DT table/NN ,/, an/DT investor/NN should/MD know/VB that/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT option/NN insurance/NN can/MD be/VB partially/RB offset/VBN *-1/-NONE- by/IN any/DT dividends/NNS that/WDT the/DT stock/NN pays/VBZ *T*-2/-NONE- ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, Tenneco/NNP Inc./NNP pays/VBZ a/DT quarterly/JJ dividend/NN of/IN 76/CD cents/NNS ,/, which/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- would/MD be/VB received/VBN *-2/-NONE- before/IN the/DT February/NNP option/NN expires/VBZ and/CC ,/, thus/RB ,/, reduce/VB the/DT cost/NN of/IN */-NONE- using/VBG the/DT technique/NN by/IN that/DT amount/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT investor/NN 's/POS risk/NN would/MD n't/RB exceed/VB 3.6/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT total/JJ investment/NN ./.
*/-NONE- To/TO simplify/VB the/DT calculations/NNS ,/, commissions/NNS on/IN the/DT option/NN and/CC underlying/JJ stock/NN are/VBP n't/RB included/VBN *-1/-NONE- in/IN the/DT table/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP more/JJR than/IN 650/CD stocks/NNS on/IN which/WDT options/NNS *T*-2/-NONE- may/MD be/VB bought/VBN and/CC sold/VBN *-1/-NONE- ,/, including/VBG some/DT over-the-counter/JJ stocks/NNS ./.
But/CC some/DT investors/NNS might/MD prefer/VB a/DT simpler/JJR strategy/NN then/RB */-NONE- hedging/VBG their/PRP$ individual/JJ holdings/NNS ./.
They/PRP can/MD do/VB this/DT by/IN *-3/-NONE- purchasing/VBG ``/`` index/NN puts/VBZ ,/, ''/'' which/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- are/VBP simply/RB put/VBN options/NNS on/IN indexes/NNS that/WDT *T*-2/-NONE- match/VBP broad/JJ baskets/NNS of/IN stocks/NNS ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ index/NN option/NN is/VBZ the/DT S&P/NNP 100/CD option/NN ,/, commonly/RB called/VBN */-NONE- the/DT OEX/NNP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ based/VBN *-1/-NONE- on/IN the/DT stocks/NNS that/WDT *T*-2/-NONE- make/VBP up/RP Standard/NNP &/CC Poor/NNP 's/POS 100-stock/CD index/NN ./.
Unlike/IN options/NNS on/IN individual/JJ issues/NNS ,/, index/NN options/NNS are/VBP settled/VBN *-1/-NONE- only/RB in/IN cash/NN ,/, and/CC no/DT stock/NN is/VBZ ever/RB tendered/VBN *-2/-NONE- ./.
But/CC while/IN index/NN options/NNS are/VBP convenient/JJ ,/, they/PRP have/VBP several/JJ disadvantages/NNS ./.
For/IN one/CD thing/NN ,/, an/DT investor/NN 's/POS portfolio/NN might/MD not/RB closely/RB match/VB the/DT S&P/NNP 100/CD ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, the/DT OEX/NNP insurance/NN may/MD *RNR*-1/-NONE- or/CC may/MD not/RB *RNR*-1/-NONE- fully/RB protect/VB an/DT investor/NN 's/POS holdings/NNS in/IN the/DT event/NN of/IN a/DT market/NN decline/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, OEX/NNP options/NNS were/VBD suspended/VBN *-501/-NONE- from/IN trading/VBG last/JJ Friday/NNP afternoon/NN ,/, after/IN the/DT stock-market/NN sell-off/NN got/VBD under/IN way/NN and/CC trading/NN in/IN the/DT S&P-500/NNP futures/NNS contract/NN was/VBD halted/VBN *-502/-NONE- ./.
So/IN an/DT investor/NN who/WP *T*-1/-NONE- wanted/VBD *-2/-NONE- to/TO realize/VB a/DT profit/NN on/IN OEX/NNP puts/NNS after/IN the/DT trading/NN suspension/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN out/IN of/IN luck/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, only/RB a/DT handful/NN of/IN individual/JJ issues/NNS were/VBD suspended/VBN *-1/-NONE- from/IN trading/VBG on/IN Friday/NNP ./.
Normally/RB ,/, once/RB the/DT underlying/JJ investment/NN is/VBZ suspended/VBN *-1/-NONE- from/IN trading/VBG ,/, the/DT options/NNS on/IN those/DT investments/NNS also/RB do/VBP n't/RB trade/VB ./.
Ultimately/RB ,/, whether/IN the/DT insurance/NN provided/VBN */-NONE- by/IN */-NONE- purchasing/VBG puts/NNS is/VBZ worthwhile/JJ depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT options/NNS ./.
That/DT cost/NN rises/VBZ in/IN times/NNS of/IN high/JJ market/NN volatility/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP still/RB might/MD be/VB cheaper/JJR than/IN */-NONE- taking/VBG a/DT major/JJ hit/NN ./.
The/DT protection/NN from/IN */-NONE- using/VBG married/JJ puts/NNS is/VBZ clearly/RB superior/JJ to/TO that/DT afforded/VBN */-NONE- by/IN another/DT options/NNS strategy/NN 0/-NONE- some/DT investors/NNS consider/VBP *-3/-NONE- using/VBG *T*-2/-NONE- during/IN troubled/JJ times/NNS :/: */-NONE- selling/VBG call/NN options/NNS on/IN stocks/NNS 0/-NONE- the/DT investor/NN owns/VBZ *T*-1/-NONE- ./.
A/DT call/NN option/NN is/VBZ similar/JJ to/TO a/DT put/NN ,/, except/IN that/IN it/PRP gives/VBZ its/PRP$ owner/NN the/DT right/NN */-NONE- to/TO buy/VB shares/NNS at/IN a/DT stated/JJ price/NN until/IN expiration/NN ./.
*/-NONE- Selling/VBG a/DT call/NN option/NN gives/VBZ an/DT investor/NN a/DT small/JJ buffer/NN against/IN a/DT stock-market/NN decline/NN ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ because/IN it/PRP reduces/VBZ the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT stock/NN by/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN premium/NN received/VBN */-NONE- from/IN the/DT sale/NN of/IN the/DT call/NN ./.
But/CC if/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN the/DT stock/NN rises/VBZ above/IN the/DT strike/NN price/NN of/IN the/DT option/NN ,/, the/DT stock/NN is/VBZ almost/RB certain/JJ *-1/-NONE- to/TO be/VB called/VBN *-2/-NONE- away/RP ./.
And/CC in/IN that/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT investor/NN misses/VBZ out/RP on/IN any/DT major/JJ upside/JJ gain/NN ./.
These/DT calculations/NNS exclude/VBP the/DT effect/NN of/IN commissions/NNS paid/VBN */-NONE- and/CC dividends/NNS received/VBN */-NONE- from/IN the/DT stock/NN ./.
