This/DT year/NN is/VBZ the/DT 75th/JJ anniversary/NN of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP System/NNP ,/, and/CC some/DT members/NNS of/IN Congress/NNP think/VBP 0/-NONE- it/PRP 's/VBZ time/NN 0/-NONE- */-NONE- to/TO take/VB a/DT fresh/JJ look/NN at/IN the/DT nation/NN 's/POS central/JJ bank/NN *T*-1/-NONE- ./.
After/IN 75/CD years/NNS there/RB may/MD be/VB a/DT few/JJ things/NNS that/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- are/VBP worth/JJ */-NONE- reexamining/VBG ./.
The/DT regional/JJ Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP Bank/NNP setup/NN ,/, for/IN instance/NN ,/, may/MD be/VB out/IN of/IN date/NN ./.
In/IN earlier/JJR years/NNS it/PRP *EXP*-1/-NONE- may/MD have/VB seemed/VBN reasonable/JJ */-NONE- to/TO give/VB Richmond/NNP ,/, Va./NNP ,/, a/DT bank/NN and/CC allow/VB Los/NNP Angeles/NNP only/RB a/DT branch/NN of/IN the/DT San/NNP Francisco/NNP bank/NN ,/, but/CC times/NNS have/VBP changed/VBN ./.
Maybe/RB the/DT whole/JJ regional/JJ system/NN is/VBZ an/DT anachronism/NN ;/: the/DT Fed/NNP ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, is/VBZ a/DT national/JJ central/JJ bank/NN ./.
Some/DT of/IN the/DT would-be/JJ reformers/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, want/VBP *-1/-NONE- to/TO restore/VB an/DT arrangement/NN 0/-NONE- we/PRP once/RB had/VBD *T*-2/-NONE- --/: or/CC ,/, at/IN least/JJS ,/, part/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
In/IN the/DT beginning/NN ,/, the/DT treasury/NN secretary/NN and/CC the/DT comptroller/NN of/IN the/DT currency/NN were/VBD both/DT ex/FW officio/FW members/NNS of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP Board/NNP ./.
But/CC in/IN 1935/CD ,/, when/WRB Congress/NNP was/VBD trying/VBG *-2/-NONE- to/TO find/VB someone/NN or/CC something/NN 0/-NONE- */-NONE- to/TO blame/VB *T*-4/-NONE- for/IN the/DT Great/NNP Depression/NNP *T*-1/-NONE- ,/, it/PRP decided/VBD *-3/-NONE- to/TO drop/VB both/PDT the/DT secretary/NN and/CC the/DT comptroller/NN from/IN the/DT board/NN ./.
Carter/NNP Glass/NNP ,/, a/DT former/JJ treasury/NN secretary/NN who/WP *T*-1/-NONE- was/VBD then/RB back/RB in/IN Congress/NNP ,/, probably/RB influenced/VBD the/DT decision/NN ./.
He/PRP said/VBD that/IN when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD on/IN the/DT board/NN *T*-1/-NONE- he/PRP felt/VBD that/IN he/PRP had/VBD a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN power/NN and/CC ,/, somehow/RB ,/, he/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB 0/-NONE- that/DT was/VBD a/DT good/JJ thing/NN ./.
Times/NNS have/VBP changed/VBN ./.
Rep./NNP Byron/NNP Dorgan/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, N.D/NNP ./. -RRB-/-RRB- has/VBZ introduced/VBN a/DT bill/NN *ICH*-1/-NONE- *ICH*-2/-NONE- in/IN Congress/NNP ,/, co-sponsored/VBN */-NONE- by/IN Rep./NNP Lee/NNP Hamilton/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Ind./NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, that/WDT *T*-3/-NONE- would/MD put/VB the/DT treasury/NN secretary/NN back/RB on/IN the/DT board/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ doubt/NN that/IN the/DT change/NN would/MD accomplish/VB much/RB but/CC at/IN least/JJS Congress/NNP ,/, as/IN in/IN 1935/CD ,/, would/MD be/VB doing/VBG something/NN ./.
So/IN far/RB no/DT one/NN has/VBZ suggested/VBN */-NONE- putting/VBG the/DT comptroller/NN back/RB on/IN the/DT board/NN ./.
Nicholas/NNP Brady/NNP ,/, the/DT incumbent/JJ treasury/NN secretary/NN ,/, is/VBZ of/IN course/NN aware/JJ of/IN the/DT proposal/NN ,/, and/CC he/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB like/VB it/PRP much/RB ./.
Mr./NNP Dorgen/NNP has/VBZ changed/VBN tactics/NNS ,/, *-1/-NONE- dropping/VBG the/DT seat-for-the-secretary/JJ idea/NN ./.
That/DT may/MD have/VB pleased/VBN the/DT secretary/NN ,/, but/CC H./NNP Erich/NNP Heinemann/NNP ,/, chief/NN economist/NN of/IN the/DT investment/NN firm/NN of/IN Ladenburg/NNP ,/, Thalmann/NNP &/CC Co./NNP ,/, suggests/VBZ that/IN Mr./NNP Brady/NNP may/MD figure/VB 0/-NONE- he/PRP already/RB has/VBZ all/PDT the/DT power/NN 0/-NONE- he/PRP needs/VBZ *T*-1/-NONE- ./.
Like/IN most/JJS treasury/NN secretaries/NNS ,/, Mr./NNP Brady/NNP takes/VBZ a/DT keen/JJ interest/NN in/IN monetary/JJ matters/NNS ,/, of/IN course/NN ./.
He/PRP was/VBD ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, taking/VBG an/DT especially/RB keen/JJ interest/NN in/IN board/NN matters/NNS even/RB before/IN he/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT treasury/NN ./.
After/IN the/DT October/NNP 1987/CD market/NN crash/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Brady/NNP as/IN a/DT private/JJ citizen/NN headed/VBD a/DT presidential/JJ commission/NN that/WDT *T*-2/-NONE- tried/VBD *-5/-NONE- to/TO decide/VB what/WP *T*-3/-NONE- went/VBD wrong/JJ and/CC what/WP *T*-4/-NONE- should/MD be/VB done/VBN *-1/-NONE- about/IN it/PRP ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT commission/NN 's/POS recommendations/NNS was/VBD that/IN a/DT single/JJ agency/NN ,/, probably/RB the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP ,/, should/MD coordinate/VB regulation/NN of/IN all/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ./.
This/DT recommendation/NN might/MD have/VB encouraged/VBN a/DT turf-hungry/JJ bureaucrat/NN to/TO try/VB *-1/-NONE- to/TO expand/VB his/PRP$ power/NN ,/, but/CC so/RB far/JJ Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP Chairman/NNP Alan/NNP Greenspan/NNP has/VBZ n't/RB made/VBN a/DT pitch/NN for/IN the/DT job/NN ./.
The/DT Fed/NNP has/VBZ plenty/NN of/IN responsibilities/NNS in/IN times/NNS of/IN market/NN turmoil/NN and/CC in/IN 1987/CD and/CC again/RB in/IN 1989/CD it/PRP appears/VBZ *-1/-NONE- to/TO have/VB handled/VBN them/PRP well/RB ./.
Mr./NNP Brady/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN 0/-NONE- he/PRP thought/VBD 0/-NONE- government/NN agencies/NNS in/IN the/DT latest/JJS market/NN drop/NN were/VBD better/RB prepared/VBN *-2/-NONE- to/TO coordinate/VB their/PRP$ actions/NNS ,/, but/CC he/PRP has/VBZ left/VBN no/DT doubt/NN that/IN he/PRP still/RB likes/VBZ the/DT ideas/NNS 0/-NONE- the/DT commission/NN advanced/VBD *T*-1/-NONE- nearly/RB two/CD years/NNS ago/IN ./.
In/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS ,/, moreover/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Brady/NNP has/VBZ joined/VBN other/JJ administration/NN officials/NNS in/IN *-2/-NONE- trying/VBG *-1/-NONE- to/TO urge/VB the/DT Fed/NNP toward/IN lower/JJR interest/NN rates/NNS ./.
The/DT urging/VBG admittedly/RB has/VBZ been/VBN gentle/JJ ./.
In/IN an/DT interview/NN with/IN the/DT Washington/NNP Post/NNP in/IN early/JJ October/NNP ,/, the/DT secretary/NN said/VBD 0/-NONE- the/DT Fed/NNP may/MD be/VB slightly/RB more/RBR interested/JJ in/IN *-1/-NONE- curbing/VBG inflation/NN than/IN the/DT administration/NN is/VBZ *?*/-NONE- ,/, while/IN the/DT administration/NN may/MD put/VB slightly/RB more/JJR emphasis/NN on/IN */-NONE- spurring/VBG economic/JJ growth/NN ./.
At/IN least/JJS some/DT economists/NNS ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, would/MD argue/VB that/IN inflation/NN deserves/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN emphasis/NN ./.
Earlier/RBR this/DT month/NN the/DT St./NNP Louis/NNP Fed/NNP held/VBD a/DT conference/NN *-1/-NONE- to/TO assess/VB the/DT system/NN 's/POS first/JJ 75/CD years/NNS ./.
Allan/NNP Meltzer/NNP ,/, a/DT Carnegie-Mellon/NNP University/NNP economist/NN ,/, noted/VBD that/IN the/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS record/NN included/VBD the/DT longest/JJS ,/, most/RBS sustained/VBN ,/, peacetime/NN inflation/NN in/IN our/PRP$ history/NN ,/, dating/VBG from/IN either/RB 1966/CD or/CC 1967/CD to/TO 1989/CD ./.
The/DT inflation-growth/NN argument/NN is/VBZ an/DT old/JJ one/CD ,/, but/CC Mr./NNP Brady/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT board/NN or/CC off/IN ,/, is/VBZ surely/RB trying/VBG *-2/-NONE- to/TO influence/VB Fed/NNP policy/NN ./.
Equally/RB importantly/RB ,/, the/DT treasury/NN secretary/NN has/VBZ spearheaded/VBN the/DT administration/NN effort/NN */-NONE- to/TO bring/VB the/DT U.S./NNP dollar/NN down/RP by/IN */-NONE- shopping/VBG avidly/RB for/IN West/JJ German/JJ marks/NNS and/CC Japanese/JJ yen/NNS ./.
The/DT treasury/NN can/MD do/VB something/NN on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, but/CC *-1/-NONE- to/TO have/VB any/DT hope/NN of/IN success/NN it/PRP needs/VBZ help/NN from/IN the/DT Fed/NNP ./.
The/DT central/JJ bank/NN has/VBZ been/VBN helping/VBG ,/, but/CC apparently/RB not/RB especially/RB eagerly/RB ./.
The/DT Fed/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN intervening/VBG in/IN foreign/JJ currency/NN markets/NNS ,/, all/RB right/JJ ,/, but/CC through/IN August/NNP ,/, at/IN least/JJS ,/, it/PRP appeared/VBD *-1/-NONE- to/TO be/VB ``/`` sterilizing/VBG ''/'' the/DT intervention/NN ./.
In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD offsetting/VBG purchases/NNS of/IN marks/NNS and/CC yen/NN by/IN *-1/-NONE- buying/VBG dollars/NNS in/IN the/DT domestic/JJ money/NN market/NN ./.
Now/RB ,/, sterilized/VBN intervention/NN may/MD have/VB some/DT effect/NN ./.
When/WRB traders/NNS see/VBP 0/-NONE- the/DT Fed/NNP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT exchange/NN market/NN *T*-1/-NONE- it/PRP may/MD make/VB them/PRP tread/VB a/DT little/JJ carefully/RB ,/, for/IN fear/NN of/IN what/WP the/DT central/JJ bank/NN may/MD do/VB *T*-2/-NONE- ./.
But/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ generally/RB accepted/VBN that/IN sterilized/VBN intervention/NN has/VBZ little/RB or/CC no/DT lasting/JJ impact/NN on/IN currency/NN values/NNS ./.
After/IN August/NNP the/DT Fed/NNP may/MD have/VB stopped/VBN *-1/-NONE- sterilizing/VBG ,/, but/CC it/PRP *EXP*-3/-NONE- 's/VBZ hard/JJ */-NONE- to/TO see/VB much/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT dollar/NN ./.
The/DT dollar/NN is/VBZ still/RB highly/RB volatile/JJ ./.
The/DT Fed/NNP has/VBZ let/VBN interest/NN rates/NNS slip/VBP slightly/RB ,/, but/CC whether/IN the/DT main/JJ reason/NN was/VBD dollar/NN intervention/NN ,/, the/DT gloomy/JJ reports/NNS on/IN manufacturing/VBG employment/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT Friday/NNP 13/CD market/NN drop/NN ,/, only/RB Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ associates/NNS know/VBP *T*-1/-NONE- ./.
Earlier/RBR this/DT year/NN ,/, Martin/NNP Feldstein/NNP ,/, president/NN of/IN the/DT National/NNP Bureau/NNP of/IN Economic/NNP Research/NNP ,/, argued/VBD forcefully/RB that/IN a/DT government/NN that/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- wants/VBZ steady/JJ ,/, stable/JJ exchange/NN rates/NNS might/MD try/VB some/DT steady/JJ stable/JJ economic/JJ policies/NNS ./.
*/-NONE- Trying/VBG *-1/-NONE- to/TO manage/VB exchange/NN rates/NNS to/TO some/DT desired/VBN level/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD 0/-NONE- *T*-2/-NONE- ,/, ``/`` would/MD mean/VB */-NONE- diverting/VBG monetary/JJ and/CC fiscal/JJ policies/NNS from/IN their/PRP$ customary/JJ roles/NNS and/CC thereby/RB risking/VBG excessive/JJ inflation/NN and/CC unemployment/NN and/CC inadequate/JJ capital/NN formation/NN ./.
