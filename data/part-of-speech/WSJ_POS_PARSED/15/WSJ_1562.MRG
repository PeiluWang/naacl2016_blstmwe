Market/NNP Order/NNP :/: This/DT is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT most/RBS widely/RB used/VBN order/NN --/: and/CC the/DT one/CD most/RBS open/JJ to/TO abuse/VB by/IN unscrupulous/JJ floor/NN brokers/NNS ,/, since/IN it/PRP imposes/VBZ no/DT price/NN restrictions/NNS ./.

Stop/NNP Order/NNP :/: Stop/VB orders/NNS tell/VB a/DT floor/NN broker/NN *-1/-NONE- to/TO buy/VB or/CC sell/VB an/DT investment/NN once/IN the/DT price/NN reaches/VBZ a/DT certain/JJ level/NN ./.
Once/RB the/DT price/NN reaches/VBZ that/DT level/NN ,/, a/DT stop/NN order/NN turns/VBZ into/IN a/DT market/NN order/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT order/NN is/VBZ filled/VBN *-1/-NONE- at/IN whatever/WDT price/NN the/DT broker/NN can/MD get/VB *T*-2/-NONE- ./.
