While/IN this/DT theory/NN is/VBZ exceedingly/RB simple/JJ ,/, it/PRP appears/VBZ *-1/-NONE- to/TO explain/VB several/JJ things/NNS ./.
First/JJ ,/, why/WRB ticket/NN splitting/NN has/VBZ increased/VBN and/CC taken/VBN the/DT peculiar/JJ pattern/NN that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ *?*/-NONE- *T*-1/-NONE- over/IN the/DT past/JJ half/JJ century/NN *T*-2/-NONE- :/: Prior/RB to/TO the/DT election/NN of/IN Franklin/NNP Roosevelt/NNP as/IN president/NN and/CC the/DT advent/NN of/IN the/DT New/NNP Deal/NNP ,/, government/NN occupied/VBD a/DT much/RB smaller/JJR role/NN in/IN society/NN and/CC the/DT prisoner/NN 's/POS dilemma/NN problem/NN confronting/VBG voters/NNS in/IN races/NNS for/IN Congress/NNP was/VBD considerably/RB less/RBR severe/JJ ./.
Second/JJ ,/, it/PRP explains/VBZ why/WRB voters/NNS hold/VBP Congress/NNP in/IN disdain/NN but/CC generally/RB love/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ congressional/JJ representatives/NNS *T*-2/-NONE- :/: Any/DT individual/JJ legislator/NN 's/POS constituents/NNS appreciate/VBP the/DT specific/JJ benefits/NNS that/IN the/DT legislator/NN wins/VBZ *T*-1/-NONE- for/IN them/PRP but/CC not/RB the/DT overall/JJ cost/NN associated/VBN */-NONE- with/IN every/DT other/JJ legislator/NN doing/VBG likewise/RB for/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ constituency/NN ./.
Third/JJ ,/, the/DT theory/NN suggests/VBZ why/WRB legislators/NNS who/WP *T*-1/-NONE- pay/VBP too/RB much/JJ attention/NN to/TO national/JJ policy/NN making/NN relative/JJ to/TO local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN have/VBP lower/JJR security/NN in/IN office/NN *T*-2/-NONE- ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, first-term/JJ members/NNS of/IN the/DT House/NN ,/, once/RB the/DT most/RBS vulnerable/JJ of/IN incumbents/NNS ,/, have/VBP become/VBN virtually/RB immune/JJ to/TO defeat/VB ./.
The/DT one/CD exception/NN to/TO this/DT recent/JJ trend/NN was/VBD the/DT defeat/NN of/IN 13/CD of/IN the/DT 52/CD freshman/NN Republicans/NNS brought/VBD */-NONE- into/IN office/NN in/IN 1980/CD by/IN the/DT Reagan/NNP revolution/NN and/CC running/VBG for/IN re-election/NN in/IN 1982/CD ./.

Fourth/JJ ,/, the/DT theory/NN indicates/VBZ why/WRB the/DT Republican/NNP Party/NNP may/MD have/VB a/DT difficult/JJ time/NN */-NONE- attracting/VBG viable/JJ candidates/NNS for/IN congressional/JJ office/NN *T*-1/-NONE- ./.
Potential/JJ candidates/NNS may/MD be/VB discouraged/VBN *-1/-NONE- from/IN *-2/-NONE- running/VBG less/RBR *ICH*-3/-NONE- by/IN the/DT congressional/JJ salary/NN than/IN by/IN the/DT prospect/NN of/IN defeat/NN at/IN the/DT hands/NNS of/IN a/DT Democratic/JJ opponent/NN ./.
To/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN potential/JJ Republican/NNP candidates/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ financial/JJ backers/NNS realize/VBP that/IN the/DT congressional/JJ prisoner/NN 's/POS dilemma/NN game/NN works/VBZ to/TO their/PRP$ disadvantage/NN ,/, the/DT Republican/NNP Party/NNP will/MD be/VB hindered/VBN *-1/-NONE- in/IN its/PRP$ attempts/NNS */-NONE- to/TO field/VB a/DT competitive/JJ slate/NN of/IN congressional/JJ candidates/NNS ./.
Fifth/JJ ,/, the/DT theory/NN may/MD provide/VB at/IN least/JJS a/DT partial/JJ reason/NN for/IN why/WRB ticket/NN splitting/NN has/VBZ been/VBN particularly/RB pronounced/VBN *-1/-NONE- in/IN the/DT South/NNP *T*-2/-NONE- ./.
To/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN Democratic/JJ legislators/NNS from/IN the/DT South/NNP have/VBP held/VBN a/DT disproportionate/JJ share/NN of/IN power/NN in/IN Congress/NNP since/IN 1932/CD and/CC have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ *-2/-NONE- to/TO translate/VB such/JJ clout/NN into/IN relatively/RB more/JJR local/JJ benefits/NNS for/IN their/PRP$ respective/JJ constituencies/NNS ,/, voters/NNS in/IN the/DT South/NNP have/VBP had/VBD an/DT especially/RB strong/JJ incentive/NN */-NONE- to/TO keep/VB such/JJ Democrats/NNS in/IN office/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, the/DT theory/NN suggests/VBZ why/WRB Republicans/NNS generally/RB have/VBP fared/VBN better/RBR *ICH*-2/-NONE- in/IN Senate/NNP races/NNS than/IN in/IN campaigns/NNS for/IN the/DT House/NNP *T*-1/-NONE- ./.
Since/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN matters/VBZ more/RBR and/CC national/JJ policy/NN making/NN matters/VBZ less/RBR in/IN the/DT lower/JJR chamber/NN of/IN Congress/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT pattern/NN 0/-NONE- one/PRP would/MD expect/VB *T*-1/-NONE- if/IN Republicans/NNS are/VBP less/RBR willing/JJ *-2/-NONE- to/TO engage/VB in/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN than/IN their/PRP$ Democratic/JJ counterparts/NNS ./.
Is/VBZ there/EX any/DT empirical/JJ support/NN for/IN this/DT theory/NN ?/.
Three/CD pieces/NNS of/IN evidence/NN corroborate/VBP the/DT key/JJ assumption/NN that/IN Democratic/JJ legislators/NNS are/VBP more/RBR willing/JJ *-1/-NONE- to/TO engage/VB in/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN than/IN their/PRP$ Republican/JJ colleagues/NNS ./.

To/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN the/DT primary/JJ duty/NN of/IN personal/JJ staff/NN involves/VBZ local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN ,/, this/DT indicates/VBZ that/IN political/JJ philosophy/NN leads/VBZ congressional/JJ Republicans/NNS to/TO pay/VB less/JJR attention/NN to/TO narrow/JJ constituent/NN concerns/NNS ./.
Second/JJ ,/, if/IN the/DT key/JJ assumption/NN is/VBZ valid/JJ ,/, Democrats/NNS should/MD have/VB lower/JJR attendance/NN rates/NNS on/IN roll-call/NN votes/NNS than/IN Republicans/NNS do/VBP to/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN such/JJ votes/NNS reflect/VBP national/JJ policy/NN making/NN and/CC that/IN */-NONE- participating/VBG in/IN such/JJ votes/NNS takes/VBZ away/RP from/IN the/DT time/NN 0/-NONE- a/DT legislator/NN could/MD otherwise/RB devote/VB to/TO local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN *T*-1/-NONE- ./.
This/DT is/VBZ indeed/RB what/WP the/DT data/NNS indicate/VBP *T*-1/-NONE- ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP ./.
The/DT Democratic/JJ House/NNP attendance/NN rate/NN has/VBZ not/RB exceeded/VBN the/DT Republican/JJ House/NNP attendance/NN rate/NN since/IN 1959/CD ./.
Finally/RB ,/, as/IN */-NONE- shown/VBN in/IN the/DT table/NN ,/, Democrats/NNS allocate/VBP a/DT higher/JJR proportion/NN of/IN their/PRP$ personal/JJ staffs/NNS to/TO district/NN offices/NNS --/: where/WRB local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN duties/NNS matter/VBP more/RBR and/CC national/JJ policy/NN making/NN activities/NNS matter/VBP less/RBR relative/JJ to/TO Washington/NNP offices/NNS *T*-1/-NONE- ./.
