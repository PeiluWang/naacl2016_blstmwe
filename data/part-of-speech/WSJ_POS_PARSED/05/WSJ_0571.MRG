Last/JJ week/NN the/DT British/NNPS displayed/VBD unusual/JJ political/JJ immaturity/NN ./.
The/DT Chancellor/NNP of/IN the/DT Exchequer/NNP ,/, Nigel/NNP Lawson/NNP ,/, resigned/VBD because/IN Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Thatcher/NNP would/MD not/RB fire/VB her/PRP trusted/VBN adviser/NN Sir/NNP Alan/NNP Walters/NNP ./.
The/DT opposition/NN Labor/NNP Party/NNP leader/NN ,/, Neil/NNP Kinnock/NNP ,/, in/IN a/DT display/NN of/IN the/DT male/JJ chauvinism/NN typical/JJ of/IN the/DT British/JJ lower/JJR class/NN ,/, denounced/VBD Mrs./NNP Thatcher/NNP for/IN *-2/-NONE- having/VBG an/DT independent/JJ mind/NN and/CC refusing/VBG *-1/-NONE- to/TO heed/VB the/DT men/NNS in/IN her/PRP$ Cabinet/NNP ./.
The/DT British/JJ press/NN ,/, *-2/-NONE- making/VBG a/DT mountain/NN out/IN of/IN a/DT molehill/NN ,/, precipitated/VBD an/DT unnecessary/JJ economic/JJ crisis/NN by/IN *-2/-NONE- portraying/VBG Mrs./NNP Thatcher/NNP as/IN an/DT autocrat/NN who/WP *T*-1/-NONE- had/VBD thrown/VBN economic/JJ policy/NN into/IN confusion/NN by/IN *-3/-NONE- driving/VBG a/DT respected/VBN figure/NN from/IN her/PRP$ government/NN ./.
Behind/IN the/DT silly/JJ posturing/NN lies/VBZ *T*-1/-NONE- a/DT real/JJ dispute/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ European-minded/JJ colleagues/NNS want/VBP the/DT British/JJ pound/NN formally/RB tied/VBN to/TO the/DT West/JJ German/JJ mark/NN ./.
Sir/NNP Alan/NNP considers/VBZ this/DT an/DT ill-advised/JJ and/CC costly/JJ policy/NN ./.
As/IN there/EX is/VBZ an/DT effort/NN */-NONE- to/TO ``/`` anchor/VB the/DT dollar/NN ''/'' either/CC to/TO gold/NN or/CC other/JJ currencies/NNS ,/, the/DT dispute/NN is/VBZ worth/JJ */-NONE- examining/VBG *-1/-NONE- ./.
Until/IN his/PRP$ resignation/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP had/VBD been/VBN *-2/-NONE- conducting/VBG British/JJ monetary/JJ policy/NN as/IN if/IN the/DT pound/NN were/VBD tied/VBN *-1/-NONE- to/TO the/DT mark/NN ./.
When/WRB Mrs./NNP Thatcher/NNP cut/VBD the/DT top/JJ tax/NN rate/NN to/TO 40/CD %/NN *T*-1/-NONE- ,/, Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP flooded/VBD the/DT country/NN with/IN money/NN *-2/-NONE- to/TO prevent/VB the/DT pound/NN from/IN *-3/-NONE- rising/VBG against/IN the/DT mark/NN ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, he/PRP reignited/VBD the/DT inflation/NN that/IN Mrs./NNP Thatcher/NNP ,/, through/IN a/DT long/JJ and/CC costly/JJ effort/NN ,/, had/VBD subdued/VBN *T*-1/-NONE- ./.
With/IN inflation/NN surging/VBG ,/, the/DT pound/NN began/VBD *-1/-NONE- falling/VBG against/IN the/DT mark/NN ./.
*-2/-NONE- To/TO keep/VB the/DT exchange/NN rate/NN pegged/VBD *-1/-NONE- ,/, Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP tightened/VBD monetary/JJ policy/NN and/CC pushed/VBD interest/NN rates/NNS up/RB to/TO 15/CD %/NN ./.
This/DT doubled/VBD the/DT mortgage/NN interest/NN rates/NNS of/IN the/DT many/JJ new/JJ homeowners/NNS that/IN Mrs./NNP Thatcher/NNP 's/POS policies/NNS had/VBD created/VBN *T*-1/-NONE- ,/, *-2/-NONE- producing/VBG widespread/JJ disaffection/NN and/CC pushing/VBG Labor/NN ahead/RB in/IN the/DT polls/NNS ./.
Instead/RB of/IN *-2/-NONE- realizing/VBG his/PRP$ mistake/NN in/IN *-3/-NONE- letting/VBG the/DT exchange/NN rate/NN dominate/VB both/DT British/JJ economic/JJ policy/NN and/CC Mrs./NNP Thatcher/NNP 's/POS political/JJ fortune/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP pushed/VBD for/IN */-NONE- tying/VBG the/DT pound/NN formally/RB to/TO the/DT mark/NN by/IN *-4/-NONE- entering/VBG the/DT European/NNP Monetary/NNP System/NNP ,/, which/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- subordinates/VBZ all/DT member/NN currencies/NNS to/TO German/JJ monetary/JJ policy/NN ./.
This/DT put/VBD Mrs./NNP Thatcher/NNP in/IN a/DT bind/NN ./.
The/DT concept/NN of/IN European/JJ integration/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN those/DT grand/JJ schemes/NNS that/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- appeal/VBP to/TO intellectuals/NNS ,/, the/DT media/NNS and/CC the/DT imagination/NN ,/, but/CC are/VBP full/JJ of/IN practical/JJ pitfalls/NNS ./.
If/IN the/DT pound/NN had/VBD been/VBN tied/VBN to/TO the/DT mark/NN ,/, the/DT British/NNPS would/MD have/VB been/VBN unable/JJ *-1/-NONE- to/TO cut/VB their/PRP$ exorbitant/JJ tax/NN rates/NNS ./.
The/DT reason/NN is/VBZ simple/JJ ./.
When/WRB a/DT country/NN cuts/VBZ tax/NN rates/NNS *T*-1/-NONE- ,/, it/PRP makes/VBZ itself/PRP more/RBR attractive/JJ to/TO investors/NNS and/CC drives/VBZ up/RP the/DT value/NN of/IN its/PRP$ currency/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD fear/NN of/IN */-NONE- disturbing/VBG EMS/NNP exchange-rate/JJ relationships/NNS that/WDT *T*-1/-NONE- caused/VBD the/DT Chirac/NNP government/NN in/IN France/NNP to/TO be/VB timid/JJ about/IN *-2/-NONE- cutting/VBG tax/NN rates/NNS ./.
Edouard/NNP Balladur/NNP ,/, the/DT finance/NN minister/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, was/VBD sold/VBN on/IN the/DT tax-cut/JJ policy/NN but/CC was/VBD concerned/VBN that/IN his/PRP$ government/NN would/MD be/VB criticized/VBN *-1/-NONE- as/IN anti-European/JJ for/IN *-1/-NONE- disturbing/VBG the/DT linked/VBN European/JJ currency/NN relationship/NN ./.
The/DT price/NN of/IN */-NONE- attracting/VBG capital/NN --/: whether/IN one/NN 's/POS own/JJ or/CC that/IN of/IN foreigners/NNS --/: is/VBZ a/DT trade/NN deficit/NN ./.
*-1/-NONE- To/TO avoid/VB this/DT deficit/NN Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP inflated/VBD the/DT pound/NN in/IN order/NN *-1/-NONE- to/TO prevent/VB its/PRP$ rise/NN ./.
This/DT misguided/JJ policy/NN could/MD not/RB prevent/VB a/DT British/JJ trade/NN deficit/NN ./.
Consequently/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP saddled/VBD Mrs./NNP Thatcher/NNP with/IN a/DT record/NN trade/NN deficit/NN ,/, renewed/VBN inflation/NN and/CC high/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS --/: three/CD political/JJ failures/NNS in/IN a/DT row/NN ./.

This/DT change/NN in/IN the/DT British/JJ capital/NN account/NN required/VBD an/DT offsetting/VBG change/NN in/IN the/DT trade/NN account/NN ,/, a/DT change/NN that/WDT *T*-2/-NONE- could/MD not/RB be/VB prevented/VBN *-1/-NONE- by/IN */-NONE- pegging/VBG the/DT currency/NN ./.
