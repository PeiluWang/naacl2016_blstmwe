In/IN a/DT hearing/NN before/IN the/DT House/NNP Ways/NNPS and/CC Means/NNPS Committee/NNP ,/, the/DT General/NNP Accounting/NNP Office/NNP and/CC the/DT Congressional/NNP Budget/NNP Office/NNP ,/, which/WDT both/DT are/VBP arms/NNS of/IN Congress/NNP ,/, advised/VBD the/DT new/JJ S&L/NN bailout/NN agency/NN to/TO abandon/VB plans/NNS to/TO raise/VB temporary/JJ working/JJ capital/NN through/IN debt/NN issued/VBN from/IN an/DT agency/NN that/WDT would/MD n't/RB be/VB counted/VBN on/IN the/DT federal/JJ budget/NN ./.

David/NNP Mullins/NNP ,/, assistant/NN secretary/NN of/IN the/DT Treasury/NNP ,/, said/VBD that/IN the/DT working/JJ capital/NN is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT final/JJ costs/NNS of/IN the/DT bailout/NN ,/, by/IN allowing/VBG the/DT agency/NN to/TO sell/VB savings/NNS and/CC loans/NNS without/IN their/PRP$ bad/JJ assets/NNS ,/, then/RB hold/VB the/DT assets/NNS until/IN they/PRP can/MD be/VB sold/VBN under/IN favorable/JJ conditions/NNS ./.
