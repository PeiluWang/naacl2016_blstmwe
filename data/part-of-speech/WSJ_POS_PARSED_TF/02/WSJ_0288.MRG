President/NNP Bush/NNP and/CC Soviet/JJ leader/NN Mikhail/NNP Gorbachev/NNP will/MD hold/VB an/DT informal/JJ meeting/NN in/IN early/JJ December/NNP ,/, a/DT move/NN that/WDT should/MD give/VB both/DT leaders/NNS a/DT political/JJ boost/NN at/IN home/NN ./.
The/DT White/NNP House/NNP is/VBZ purposely/RB not/RB calling/VBG the/DT meeting/NN a/DT summit/NN so/IN that/IN there/EX wo/MD n't/RB be/VB any/DT expectation/NN of/IN detailed/JJ negotiations/NNS or/CC agreements/NNS ./.
Rather/RB ,/, senior/JJ administration/NN officials/NNS said/VBD that/IN the/DT unexpected/JJ meeting/NN was/VBD scheduled/VBN at/IN Mr./NNP Bush/NNP 's/POS request/NN because/IN of/IN his/PRP$ preference/NN for/IN conducting/VBG diplomacy/NN through/IN highly/RB personal/JJ and/CC informal/JJ meetings/NNS with/IN other/JJ leaders/NNS ./.
The/DT two/CD leaders/NNS will/MD meet/VB on/IN Dec./NNP #/CD and/CC #/CD ,/, alternating/VBG the/DT two/CD days/NNS of/IN meetings/NNS between/IN a/DT U.S./NNP and/CC a/DT Soviet/JJ naval/JJ vessel/NN in/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP Sea/NNP ./.

In/IN announcing/VBG the/DT meeting/NN yesterday/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Bush/NNP told/VBD reporters/NNS at/IN the/DT White/NNP House/NNP that/IN neither/CC he/PRP nor/CC Mr./NNP Gorbachev/NNP expects/VBZ any/DT ``/`` substantial/JJ decisions/NNS or/CC agreements/NNS ./. ''/''

Despite/IN the/DT informal/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT session/NN and/CC the/DT calculated/JJ effort/NN to/TO hold/VB down/RP expectations/NNS ,/, the/DT meeting/NN could/MD pay/VB significant/JJ political/JJ dividends/NNS for/IN both/DT leaders/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Gorbachev/NNP badly/RB needs/VBZ a/DT diversion/NN from/IN the/DT serious/JJ economic/JJ problems/NNS and/CC ethnic/JJ unrest/NN he/PRP faces/VBZ at/IN home/NN ./.
American/JJ officials/NNS have/VBP said/VBN that/IN a/DT meeting/NN with/IN the/DT leader/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP could/MD help/VB bolster/VB his/PRP$ stature/NN among/IN Soviet/JJ politicians/NNS and/CC academics/NNS ,/, whose/WP$ support/NN he/PRP needs/VBZ ./.
For/IN his/PRP$ part/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Bush/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN criticized/VBN regularly/RB at/IN home/NN for/IN moving/VBG too/RB slowly/RB and/CC cautiously/RB in/IN reacting/VBG to/TO Mr./NNP Gorbachev/NNP 's/POS reforms/NNS and/CC the/DT historic/JJ moves/NNS away/RB from/IN communism/NN in/IN Eastern/NNP Europe/NNP ./.
A/DT face-to-face/JJ meeting/NN with/IN Mr./NNP Gorbachev/NNP should/MD damp/VB such/JJ criticism/NN ,/, though/IN it/PRP will/MD hardly/RB eliminate/VB it/PRP ./.
Senate/NNP Majority/NNP Leader/NNP George/NNP Mitchell/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Maine/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT most/RBS prominent/JJ Democratic/JJ critic/NN of/IN Mr./NNP Bush/NNP 's/POS handling/NN of/IN the/DT Soviet/JJ relationship/NN ,/, praised/VBD the/DT president/NN for/IN arranging/VBG the/DT meeting/NN ./.

But/CC one/CD Bush/NNP administration/NN official/NN knowledgeable/JJ about/IN the/DT summit/NN plan/NN cautioned/VBD against/IN assuming/VBG that/IN there/EX will/MD be/VB bold/JJ new/JJ initiatives/NNS on/IN the/DT Soviet/JJ economy/NN or/CC other/JJ issues/NNS ./.

``/`` Those/DT things/NNS will/MD all/DT come/VB up/RP ,/, but/CC in/IN a/DT fairly/RB informal/JJ way/NN ./. ''/''

One/CD of/IN the/DT reasons/NNS Bush/NNP administration/NN aides/NNS are/VBP anxious/JJ to/TO insist/VB that/IN the/DT coming/VBG meeting/NN will/MD be/VB informal/JJ is/VBZ to/TO avoid/VB comparisons/NNS with/IN the/DT last/JJ such/JJ loosely/RB structured/JJ superpower/NN gathering/NN ,/, former/JJ President/NNP Reagan/NNP 's/POS #/CD meeting/NN with/IN Mr./NNP Gorbachev/NNP in/IN Reykjavik/NNP ,/, Iceland/NNP ./.
