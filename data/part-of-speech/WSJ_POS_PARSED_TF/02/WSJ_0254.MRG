The/DT government/NN 's/POS primary/JJ economic-forecasting/JJ gauge/NN rose/VBD a/DT slight/JJ #.#/CD %/NN in/IN September/NNP ,/, but/CC economists/NNS said/VBD the/DT report/NN offered/VBD little/JJ new/JJ information/NN on/IN the/DT degree/NN to/TO which/WDT the/DT U.S./NNP economy/NN is/VBZ slowing/VBG ./.
The/DT small/JJ increase/NN in/IN the/DT index/NN of/IN leading/VBG indicators/NNS ,/, which/WDT had/VBD climbed/VBN #.#/CD %/NN in/IN August/NNP but/CC was/VBD unchanged/JJ in/IN July/NNP ,/, does/VBZ lend/VB support/NN to/TO the/DT view/NN that/IN the/DT economy/NN has/VBZ slowed/VBN noticeably/RB ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB give/VB much/RB of/IN a/DT clue/NN as/IN to/TO whether/IN a/DT recession/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT horizon/NN ./.
``/`` I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB it/PRP provides/VBZ much/RB new/JJ information/NN on/IN the/DT economy/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Richard/NNP Rippe/NNP ,/, economist/NN at/IN Dean/NNP Witter/NNP Reynolds/NNP Inc/NNP ./.
So/RB far/RB this/DT year/NN ,/, the/DT index/NN of/IN leading/VBG indicators/NNS has/VBZ risen/VBN in/IN four/CD months/NNS ,/, fallen/VBN in/IN four/CD months/NNS and/CC remained/VBD unchanged/JJ in/IN the/DT other/JJ month/NN ./.
In/IN another/DT report/NN yesterday/NN ,/, the/DT Commerce/NNP Department/NNP said/VBD sales/NNS of/IN new/JJ single-family/JJ houses/NNS plunged/VBD #/CD %/NN in/IN September/NNP to/TO an/DT annual/JJ rate/NN of/IN #,#/CD from/IN #,#/CD in/IN August/NNP ./.
The/DT declines/NNS were/VBD particularly/RB pronounced/VBN in/IN the/DT Northeast/NNP and/CC in/IN the/DT South/NNP ,/, where/WRB Hurricane/NNP Hugo/NNP was/VBD a/DT factor/NN ./.
Although/IN September/NNP 's/POS weakness/NN followed/VBD two/CD strong/JJ months/NNS for/IN home/NN sales/NNS ,/, the/DT decline/NN supports/VBZ other/JJ indications/NNS that/IN the/DT drop/NN in/IN mortgage/NN rates/NNS earlier/RBR this/DT year/NN has/VBZ had/VBN only/RB a/DT limited/JJ beneficial/JJ effect/NN on/IN the/DT housing/NN market/NN ./.
The/DT September/NNP drop/NN was/VBD the/DT largest/JJS since/IN a/DT #/CD %/NN drop/NN in/IN January/NNP #/CD ,/, but/CC monthly/JJ changes/NNS in/IN this/DT measure/NN are/VBP even/RB less/RBR reliable/JJ than/IN those/DT in/IN other/JJ economic/JJ indicators/NNS ./.
Because/IN the/DT figures/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN a/DT small/JJ sample/NN ,/, the/DT department/NN said/VBD it/PRP is/VBZ #/CD %/NN confident/JJ only/RB that/IN new-home/JJ sales/NNS fell/VBD somewhere/RB between/IN #/CD %/NN and/CC #/CD %/NN during/IN the/DT month/NN ./.
The/DT department/NN also/RB said/VBD it/PRP takes/VBZ four/CD months/NNS to/TO establish/VB a/DT trend/NN ./.

This/DT measure/NN had/VBD dropped/VBN sharply/RB in/IN August/NNP ./.
The/DT Commerce/NNP Department/NNP said/VBD that/IN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ adjustment/NN to/TO the/DT formula/NN used/VBN to/TO calculate/VB the/DT index/NN ,/, the/DT influence/NN of/IN this/DT component/NN has/VBZ been/VBN reduced/VBN ./.
Of/IN the/DT #/CD components/NNS to/TO the/DT index/NN ,/, only/RB three/CD others/NNS rose/VBD in/IN September/NNP :/: the/DT money/NN supply/NN ,/, the/DT length/NN of/IN the/DT average/JJ work/NN week/NN and/CC stock/NN prices/NNS ./.
Several/JJ components/NNS that/WDT track/VBP the/DT health/NN of/IN the/DT manufacturing/VBG sector/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN turned/VBD down/RB in/IN September/NNP ./.

Meanwhile/RB ,/, the/DT National/NNP Association/NNP of/IN Manufacturers/NNPS said/VBD yesterday/NN a/DT recent/JJ poll/NN of/IN #/CD executives/NNS on/IN its/PRP$ board/NN found/VBD that/IN #/CD %/NN do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB a/DT recession/NN to/TO occur/VB until/IN #/CD or/CC later/RBR ./.

Although/IN manufacturers/NNS often/RB are/VBP quick/JJ to/TO call/VB for/IN lower/JJR interest/NN rates/NNS ,/, #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT executives/NNS said/VBD they/PRP would/MD prefer/VB that/IN the/DT Fed/NNP keep/VB inflation-fighting/NN as/IN its/PRP$ top/JJ priority/NN even/RB if/IN that/DT means/VBZ higher/JJR rates/NNS ./.
The/DT other/JJ #/CD %/NN said/VBD the/DT Fed/NNP ought/MD to/TO worry/VB less/RBR about/IN inflation/NN and/CC bring/VB interest/NN rates/NNS down/RP ./.
