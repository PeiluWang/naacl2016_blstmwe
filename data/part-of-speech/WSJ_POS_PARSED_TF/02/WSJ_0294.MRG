Like/IN any/DT other/JJ creditor/NN ,/, the/DT pilots/NNS will/MD have/VB to/TO apply/VB to/TO the/DT court/NN for/IN payment/NN of/IN their/PRP$ claim/NN ./.

In/IN August/NNP ,/, he/PRP issued/VBD the/DT ruling/NN that/WDT let/VBD the/DT pilots/NNS pursue/VB their/PRP$ back-pay/NN grievance/NN before/IN the/DT arbitrator/NN ./.
The/DT pilots/NNS '/POS contract/NN with/IN Eastern/NNP calls/VBZ for/IN a/DT mutually/RB acceptable/JJ private/JJ arbitrator/NN to/TO resolve/VB such/JJ grievances/NNS ./.
In/IN a/DT statement/NN to/TO employees/NNS ,/, Eastern/NNP said/VBD the/DT company/NN was/VBD disappointed/JJ by/IN the/DT ruling/NN ./.
``/`` The/DT obligation/NN is/VBZ totally/RB unwarranted/JJ ,/, ''/'' the/DT statement/NN said/VBD ./.

``/`` This/DT is/VBZ a/DT blow/NN not/RB only/RB to/TO Eastern/NNP but/CC to/TO the/DT creditors/NNS committee/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.
Eastern/NNP 's/POS creditors/NNS committee/NN ,/, along/IN with/IN the/DT company/NN ,/, has/VBZ consistently/RB opposed/VBN the/DT pilots/NNS '/POS claim/NN ,/, which/WDT if/IN paid/VBN would/MD have/VB to/TO come/VB out/IN of/IN money/NN both/DT hope/VBP to/TO use/VB to/TO pay/VB off/RP other/JJ bankruptcy/NN claims/NNS ./.

The/DT clause/NN was/VBD part/NN of/IN an/DT agreement/NN in/IN which/WDT pilots/NNS accepted/VBD a/DT substantial/JJ pay/NN cut/NN as/RB long/RB as/IN no/DT other/JJ labor/NN group/NN got/VBD a/DT raise/NN ./.
