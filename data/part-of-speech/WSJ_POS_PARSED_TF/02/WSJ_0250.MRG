Congressional/JJ Democrats/NNPS and/CC the/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN agreed/VBD on/IN a/DT compromise/NN minimum-wage/NN bill/NN ,/, opening/VBG the/DT way/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ wage-floor/JJ boost/NN in/IN more/JJR than/IN nine/CD years/NNS ./.

White/NNP House/NNP officials/NNS were/VBD delighted/JJ that/IN the/DT compromise/NN includes/VBZ the/DT concept/NN of/IN a/DT training/NN wage/NN ,/, which/WDT Mr./NNP Bush/NNP has/VBZ fought/VBN for/IN throughout/IN the/DT year/NN ./.
