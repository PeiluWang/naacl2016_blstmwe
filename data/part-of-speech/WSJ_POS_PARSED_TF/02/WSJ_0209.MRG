Researchers/NNS at/IN Plant/NNP Genetic/NNP Systems/NNP N.V./NNP in/IN Belgium/NNP said/VBD they/PRP have/VBP developed/VBN a/DT genetic/JJ engineering/NN technique/NN for/IN creating/VBG hybrid/JJ plants/NNS for/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN key/JJ crops/NNS ./.
The/DT researchers/NNS said/VBD they/PRP have/VBP isolated/VBN a/DT plant/NN gene/NN that/WDT prevents/VBZ the/DT production/NN of/IN pollen/NN ./.
The/DT gene/NN thus/RB can/MD prevent/VB a/DT plant/NN from/IN fertilizing/VBG itself/PRP ./.
Such/JJ so-called/JJ male-sterile/JJ plants/NNS can/MD then/RB be/VB fertilized/VBN by/IN pollen/NN from/IN another/DT strain/NN of/IN the/DT plant/NN ,/, thereby/RB producing/VBG hybrid/JJ seed/NN ./.
The/DT new/JJ generation/NN of/IN plants/NNS will/MD possess/VB the/DT flourishing/JJ ,/, high-production/JJ trait/NN known/VBN as/IN ``/`` hybrid/JJ vigor/NN ,/, ''/'' similar/JJ to/TO that/DT now/RB seen/VBN in/IN hybrid/JJ corn/NN ./.
``/`` The/DT development/NN could/MD have/VB a/DT dramatic/JJ effect/NN on/IN farm/NN production/NN ,/, especially/RB cotton/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Murray/NNP Robinson/NNP ,/, president/NN of/IN Delta/NNP &/CC Pine/NNP Land/NNP Co./NNP ,/, a/DT Southwide/NNP Inc./NNP subsidiary/NN that/WDT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT largest/JJS cotton/NN seed/NN producers/NNS in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ./.
On/IN a/DT commercial/JJ scale/NN ,/, the/DT sterilization/NN of/IN the/DT pollen-producing/VBG male/JJ part/NN has/VBZ only/RB been/VBN achieved/VBN in/IN corn/NN and/CC sorghum/NN feed/NN grains/NNS ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ because/IN the/DT male/NN part/NN ,/, the/DT tassel/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT female/NN ,/, the/DT ear/NN ,/, are/VBP some/DT distance/NN apart/RB on/IN the/DT corn/NN plant/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT labor-intensive/JJ process/NN ,/, the/DT seed/NN companies/NNS cut/VBD off/RP the/DT tassels/NNS of/IN each/DT plant/NN ,/, making/VBG it/PRP male/JJ sterile/JJ ./.
They/PRP sow/VBP a/DT row/NN of/IN male-fertile/JJ plants/NNS nearby/RB ,/, which/WDT then/RB pollinate/VBP the/DT male-sterile/JJ plants/NNS ./.
The/DT first/JJ hybrid/JJ corn/NN seeds/NNS produced/VBN using/VBG this/DT mechanical/JJ approach/NN were/VBD introduced/VBN in/IN the/DT #s/NNS and/CC they/PRP yielded/VBD as/RB much/JJ as/IN #/CD %/NN more/JJR corn/NN than/IN naturally/RB pollinated/VBN plants/NNS ./.
The/DT vast/JJ majority/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP corn/NN crop/NN now/RB is/VBZ grown/VBN from/IN hybrid/JJ seeds/NNS produced/VBN by/IN seed/NN companies/NNS ./.
A/DT similar/JJ technique/NN is/VBZ almost/RB impossible/JJ to/TO apply/VB to/TO other/JJ crops/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN cotton/NN ,/, soybeans/NNS and/CC rice/NN ./.
The/DT male/JJ part/NN ,/, the/DT anthers/NNS of/IN the/DT plant/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT female/NN ,/, the/DT pistils/NNS ,/, of/IN the/DT same/JJ plant/NN are/VBP within/IN a/DT fraction/NN of/IN an/DT inch/NN or/CC even/RB attached/VBN to/TO each/DT other/JJ ./.
The/DT anthers/NNS in/IN these/DT plants/NNS are/VBP difficult/JJ to/TO clip/VB off/RP ./.
In/IN China/NNP ,/, a/DT great/JJ number/NN of/IN workers/NNS are/VBP engaged/VBN in/IN pulling/VBG out/RP the/DT male/JJ organs/NNS of/IN rice/NN plants/NNS using/VBG tweezers/NNS ,/, and/CC one-third/NN of/IN rice/NN produced/VBN in/IN that/DT country/NN is/VBZ grown/VBN from/IN hybrid/JJ seeds/NNS ./.
At/IN Plant/NNP Genetic/NNP Systems/NNPS ,/, researchers/NNS have/VBP isolated/VBN a/DT pollen-inhibiting/JJ gene/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB inserted/VBN in/IN a/DT plant/NN to/TO confer/VB male/JJ sterility/NN ./.
Jan/NNP Leemans/NNP ,/, research/NN director/NN ,/, said/VBD this/DT gene/NN was/VBD successfully/RB introduced/VBN in/IN oil-producing/JJ rapeseed/NN plants/NNS ,/, a/DT major/JJ crop/NN in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC Canada/NNP ,/, using/VBG as/IN a/DT carrier/NN a/DT ``/`` promoter/NN gene/NN ''/'' developed/VBN by/IN Robert/NNP Goldberg/NNP at/IN the/DT University/NNP of/IN California/NNP in/IN Los/NNP Angeles/NNP ./.
The/DT sterilizing/VBG gene/NN is/VBZ expressed/VBN just/RB before/IN the/DT pollen/NN is/VBZ about/IN to/TO develop/VB and/CC it/PRP deactivates/VBZ the/DT anthers/NNS of/IN every/DT flower/NN in/IN the/DT plant/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Leemans/NNP said/VBD this/DT genetic/JJ manipulation/NN does/VBZ n't/RB hurt/VB the/DT growth/NN of/IN that/DT plant/NN ./.
The/DT researchers/NNS also/RB pulled/VBD off/RP a/DT second/JJ genetic/JJ engineering/NN trick/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB male-sterile/JJ plants/NNS in/IN large/JJ enough/JJ numbers/NNS to/TO produce/VB a/DT commercial/JJ hybrid/JJ seed/NN crop/NN ./.
They/PRP attached/VBD a/DT second/JJ gene/NN ,/, for/IN herbicide/NN resistance/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT pollen-inhibiting/JJ gene/NN ./.
Both/DT genes/NNS are/VBP then/RB inserted/VBN into/IN a/DT few/JJ greenhouse/NN plants/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP then/RB pollinated/VBN and/CC allowed/VBN to/TO mature/VB and/CC produce/VB seed/NN ./.
The/DT laws/NNS of/IN heredity/NN dictate/VBP that/IN half/NN of/IN the/DT plants/NNS springing/VBG from/IN these/DT greenhouse-produced/JJ seeds/NNS will/MD be/VB male/NN sterile/JJ and/CC herbicide/NN resistant/JJ and/CC half/NN will/MD be/VB male/NN fertile/JJ and/CC herbicide/NN susceptible/JJ ./.
The/DT application/NN of/IN herbicide/NN would/MD kill/VB off/RP the/DT male-fertile/JJ plants/NNS ,/, leaving/VBG a/DT large/JJ field/NN of/IN male-sterile/JJ plants/NNS that/WDT can/MD be/VB cross-pollinated/VBN to/TO produce/VB hybrid/NN seed/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Leemans/NNP said/VBD the/DT hybrid/NN rapeseeds/NNS created/VBN with/IN this/DT genetic/JJ engineering/NN yield/NN #/CD %/NN to/TO #/CD %/NN more/JJR output/NN than/IN the/DT commercial/JJ strains/NNS used/VBN currently/RB ./.
``/`` This/DT technique/NN is/VBZ applicable/JJ to/TO a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN crops/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, and/CC added/VBD that/IN some/DT modifications/NNS may/MD be/VB necessary/JJ to/TO accommodate/VB the/DT peculiarities/NNS of/IN each/DT type/NN of/IN crop/NN ./.

He/PRP said/VBD that/IN even/RB though/IN virtually/RB all/DT corn/NN seeds/NNS currently/RB planted/VBN are/VBP hybrids/NNS ,/, the/DT genetic/JJ approach/NN will/MD obviate/VB the/DT need/NN for/IN mechanical/JJ emasculation/NN of/IN anthers/NNS ,/, which/WDT costs/VBZ U.S./NNP seed/NN producers/NNS about/IN $/$ #/CD million/CD annually/RB ./.
In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, demand/NN for/IN hybrid/NN seeds/NNS has/VBZ spurred/VBN research/NN at/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN chemical/NN and/CC biotechnology/NN companies/NNS ,/, including/VBG Monsanto/NNP Co./NNP ,/, Shell/NNP Oil/NNP Co./NNP and/CC Eli/NNP Lilly/NNP &/CC Co/NNP ./.
