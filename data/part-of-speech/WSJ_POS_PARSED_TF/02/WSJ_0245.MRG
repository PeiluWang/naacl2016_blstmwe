Coca-Cola/NNP Co./NNP ,/, aiming/VBG to/TO boost/VB soft-drink/NN volume/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, said/VBD it/PRP is/VBZ discussing/VBG a/DT joint/JJ venture/NN with/IN Fraser/NNP &/CC Neave/NNP Ltd./NNP ,/, its/PRP$ bottling/VBG franchisee/NN in/IN that/DT country/NN ./.
The/DT venture/NN would/MD be/VB the/DT latest/JJS in/IN Coke/NNP 's/POS rapid/JJ expansion/NN of/IN overseas/JJ investment/NN ./.
So/RB far/RB this/DT year/NN ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ put/VBN nearly/RB $/$ #/CD million/CD into/IN bottling/VBG operations/NNS in/IN Australia/NNP ,/, New/NNP Zealand/NNP and/CC France/NNP ./.
The/DT move/NN also/RB reflects/VBZ Coke/NNP 's/POS eagerness/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT hand/NN in/IN developing/VBG the/DT soft-drink/NN markets/NNS in/IN Pacific/NNP Basin/NNP countries/NNS ./.
Aside/RB from/IN Europe/NNP ,/, the/DT Pacific/NNP division/NN is/VBZ where/WRB Coke/NNP will/MD be/VB focusing/VBG much/RB of/IN its/PRP$ attention/NN for/IN years/NNS to/TO come/VB ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ because/IN when/WRB Coke/NNP looks/VBZ to/TO the/DT Pacific/NNP area/NN ,/, it/PRP sees/VBZ an/DT economic/JJ and/CC demographic/JJ gold/NN mine/NN ./.
In/IN countries/NNS such/JJ as/IN Taiwan/NNP ,/, South/NNP Korea/NNP and/CC Singapore/NNP ,/, economies/NNS are/VBP growing/VBG ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN a/DT rise/NN in/IN disposable/JJ income/NN that/IN consumers/NNS can/MD use/VB for/IN soft/JJ drinks/NNS ./.
And/CC unlike/IN Europe/NNP and/CC the/DT U.S./NNP ,/, where/WRB populations/NNS are/VBP aging/VBG ,/, the/DT Pacific/NNP Basin/NNP countries/NNS have/VBP growing/VBG proportions/NNS of/IN youths/NNS --/: the/DT heaviest/JJS consumers/NNS of/IN Coca-Cola/NNP and/CC other/JJ sodas/NNS ./.
A/DT Coca-Cola/NNP spokesman/NN said/VBD it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB early/JJ to/TO say/VB how/WRB the/DT joint/JJ venture/NN would/MD be/VB structured/VBN ,/, or/CC how/WRB much/JJ the/DT company/NN would/MD invest/VB in/IN the/DT transaction/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, Coke/NNP has/VBZ typically/RB taken/VBN a/DT minority/NN stake/NN in/IN such/JJ ventures/NNS ./.
By/IN acquiring/VBG stakes/NNS in/IN bottling/VBG companies/NNS in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP and/CC overseas/RB ,/, Coke/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN able/JJ to/TO improve/VB bottlers/NNS '/POS efficiency/NN and/CC production/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN some/DT cases/NNS ,/, marketing/NN ./.
Coke/NNP has/VBZ tended/VBN to/TO increase/VB its/PRP$ control/NN when/WRB results/NNS were/VBD sluggish/JJ in/IN a/DT given/VBN country/NN ./.
That/IN does/VBZ n't/RB appear/VB to/TO be/VB the/DT case/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, a/DT country/NN of/IN about/IN three/CD million/CD people/NNS with/IN a/DT relatively/RB high/JJ soft-drink/NN consumption/NN rate/NN --/: a/DT key/JJ indicator/NN of/IN Coke/NNP 's/POS success/NN in/IN a/DT market/NN ./.
In/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, per-capita/JJ consumption/NN is/VBZ about/IN one-third/NN that/IN of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ./.
And/CC combining/VBG Fraser/NNP &/CC Neave/NNP 's/POS own/JJ soft/JJ drinks/NNS with/IN Coca-Cola/NNP 's/POS gives/VBZ the/DT Singapore/NNP company/NN more/JJR than/IN half/PDT the/DT share/NN of/IN the/DT soda/NN market/NN there/RB ,/, Coke/NNP said/VBD ./.
Fraser/NNP &/CC Neave/NNP ,/, which/WDT also/RB has/VBZ interests/NNS in/IN packaging/NN ,/, beer/NN and/CC dairy/NN products/NNS ,/, holds/VBZ the/DT Coke/NNP licenses/NNS for/IN Malaysia/NNP and/CC Brunei/NNP ,/, where/WRB per-capita/JJ consumption/NN is/VBZ n't/RB as/RB high/JJ as/IN in/IN Singapore/NNP ./.
Coke/NNP could/MD be/VB interested/JJ in/IN more/RBR quickly/RB developing/VBG some/DT of/IN the/DT untapped/JJ potential/NN in/IN those/DT markets/NNS ./.
A/DT Coke/NNP spokesman/NN said/VBD he/PRP could/MD n't/RB say/VB whether/IN that/DT is/VBZ the/DT direction/NN of/IN the/DT talks/NNS ./.
