Some/DT U.S./NNP allies/NNS are/VBP complaining/VBG that/IN President/NNP Bush/NNP is/VBZ pushing/VBG conventional-arms/JJ talks/NNS too/RB quickly/RB ,/, creating/VBG a/DT risk/NN that/IN negotiators/NNS will/MD make/VB errors/NNS that/WDT could/MD affect/VB the/DT security/NN of/IN Western/NNP Europe/NNP for/IN years/NNS ./.

For/IN one/CD thing/NN ,/, Pentagon/NNP officials/NNS ,/, who/WP asked/VBD not/RB to/TO be/VB identified/VBN ,/, worry/VBP that/IN the/DT U.S./NNP will/MD have/VB a/DT much/RB tougher/JJR time/NN persuading/VBG Europeans/NNPS to/TO keep/VB some/DT short-range/JJ nuclear/JJ weapons/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ soil/NN once/IN Soviet/JJ armored/JJ forces/NNS are/VBP thinned/VBN out/RP ./.
At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, they/PRP contend/VBP that/IN a/DT reduction/NN of/IN NATO/NNP forces/NNS under/IN a/DT treaty/NN will/MD increase/VB the/DT possibility/NN of/IN a/DT conventional/JJ Soviet/JJ attack/NN unless/IN the/DT West/NNP retains/VBZ a/DT residual/JJ force/NN of/IN nuclear/JJ weapons/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

So/RB far/RB ,/, no/DT ally/NN has/VBZ complained/VBN openly/RB ,/, preserving/VBG the/DT impression/NN that/IN NATO/NNP is/VBZ in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT Bush/NNP position/NN that/IN a/DT quick/JJ agreement/NN bringing/VBG Soviet/JJ conventional/JJ forces/NNS down/RB to/TO parity/NN with/IN NATO/NNP is/VBZ the/DT West/NNP 's/POS top/JJ bargaining/NN priority/NN ./.

Oleg/NNP A./NN Grinevsky/NNP ,/, the/DT chief/JJ Soviet/JJ negotiator/NN in/IN the/DT conventional-arms/JJ talks/NNS ,/, argued/VBD that/IN this/DT would/MD mean/VB the/DT Soviets/NNPS would/MD have/VB to/TO destroy/VB some/DT #,#/CD tanks/NNS ,/, while/IN the/DT U.S./NNP would/MD lose/VB none/NN because/IN it/PRP has/VBZ no/DT light/JJ tanks/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ./.
