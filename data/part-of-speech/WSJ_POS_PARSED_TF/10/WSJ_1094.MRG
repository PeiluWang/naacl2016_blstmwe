As/IN a/DT presidential/JJ candidate/NN in/IN #/CD ,/, George/NNP Bush/NNP forthrightly/RB expressed/VBD his/PRP$ position/NN on/IN abortion/NN in/IN an/DT interview/NN with/IN Rolling/NNP Stone/NNP magazine/NN published/VBN that/IN March/NNP ./.
What/WP did/VBD he/PRP think/VB of/IN the/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP 's/POS decision/NN legalizing/VBG abortion/NN ?/.
``/`` I/PRP happen/VBP to/TO think/VB it/PRP was/VBD right/JJ ,/, ''/'' Mr./NNP Bush/NNP said/VBD flatly/RB ./.
A/DT few/JJ months/NNS later/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Bush/NNP became/VBD Ronald/NNP Reagan/NNP 's/POS running/JJ mate/NN ./.
Suddenly/RB ,/, George/NNP Bush/NNP the/DT pro-choice/JJ advocate/NN became/VBD George/NNP Bush/NNP the/DT anti-abortionist/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT vacillation/NN did/VBD n't/RB end/VB there/RB ./.
Just/RB a/DT month/NN ago/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Bush/NNP sternly/RB threatened/VBD to/TO veto/VB a/DT pending/VBG welfare/NN bill/NN if/IN it/PRP provided/VBD any/DT abortion/NN funds/NNS ,/, except/IN to/TO save/VB a/DT woman/NN 's/POS life/NN ./.
Then/RB ,/, two/CD weeks/NNS ago/RB --/: declaring/VBG that/IN ``/`` I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB looking/VBG for/IN any/DT conflict/NN over/IN this/DT ''/'' --/: the/DT president/NN said/VBD he/PRP would/MD consider/VB a/DT compromise/NN to/TO fund/VB abortions/NNS for/IN poor/JJ women/NNS in/IN cases/NNS of/IN rape/NN and/CC incest/NN ./.
But/CC only/RB four/CD days/NNS after/IN that/DT ,/, Mr./NNP Bush/NNP resurrected/VBD the/DT veto/NN threat/NN ./.
``/`` I/PRP do/VBP not/RB support/VB federal/JJ funding/NN for/IN abortions/NNS except/IN where/WRB the/DT mother/NN 's/POS life/NN is/VBZ threatened/VBN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP proclaimed/VBD ,/, and/CC finally/RB vetoed/VBD the/DT measure/NN last/JJ weekend/NN ./.
So/RB what/WP does/VBZ George/NNP Bush/NNP really/RB believe/VB ?/.
The/DT answer/NN is/VBZ so/RB murky/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ beginning/VBG to/TO get/VB this/DT popular/JJ president/NN in/IN trouble/NN with/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT increasingly/RB vocal/JJ ,/, increasingly/RB powerful/JJ sides/NNS of/IN the/DT abortion/NN issue/NN ./.
The/DT result/NN is/VBZ mistrust/NN and/CC criticism/NN from/IN all/RB around/RB ./.
Anti-abortion/JJ forces/NNS regard/VBP him/PRP as/IN at/IN best/RB an/DT uncertain/JJ ally/NN ./.
``/`` In/IN all/DT honesty/NN if/IN you/PRP ask/VBP me/PRP ,/, `/`` Is/VBZ this/DT man/NN a/DT true/JJ believer/NN ?/. '/'' I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ John/NNP Fowler/NNP ,/, head/NN of/IN the/DT Washington-based/JJ Ad/NNP Hoc/NNP Committee/NNP in/IN Defense/NNP of/IN Life/NNP Inc/NNP ./.
Yet/CC abortion-rights/JJ forces/NNS remain/VBP bitterly/RB critical/JJ ./.
Douglas/NNP Gould/NNP ,/, vice/NN president/NN of/IN communications/NNS for/IN the/DT Planned/NNP Parenthood/NNP Federation/NNP of/IN America/NNP ,/, calls/VBZ Mr./NNP Bush/NNP 's/POS position/NN on/IN the/DT abortion-funding/JJ issue/NN ``/`` extremely/RB cruel/JJ ,/, ''/'' adding/VBG :/: ``/`` The/DT guy/NN has/VBZ n't/RB done/VBN one/CD thing/NN about/IN prevention/NN ./.
He/PRP 's/VBZ totally/RB geared/VBN to/TO a/DT punitive/JJ position/NN ./. ''/''
Mr./NNP Bush/NNP is/VBZ plainly/RB uncomfortable/JJ with/IN the/DT entire/JJ abortion/NN question/NN ./.
For/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT past/JJ nine/CD years/NNS ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ striven/VBN to/TO convince/VB anti-abortion/JJ activists/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ stalwart/JJ support/NN for/IN their/PRP$ position/NN ./.
But/CC ever/RB since/IN the/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP 's/POS Webster/NNP vs./FW Reproductive/NNP Health/NNP Services/NNPS decision/NN this/DT year/NN changed/VBD the/DT political/JJ landscape/NN of/IN the/DT abortion/NN issue/NN ,/, the/DT president/NN seemingly/RB has/VBZ tried/VBN just/RB as/RB hard/JJ to/TO avoid/VB saying/VBG anything/NN more/JJR unless/IN pressed/VBN to/TO the/DT wall/NN ./.
Many/JJ Americans/NNPS still/RB agonize/VB over/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ personal/JJ feelings/NNS about/IN abortion/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Bush/NNP 's/POS problem/NN is/VBZ n't/RB so/RB much/JJ that/IN he/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB agonizing/JJ over/IN the/DT issue/NN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ that/IN he/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO vacillate/VB on/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT political/JJ risk/NN would/MD be/VB far/RB less/JJR if/IN the/DT president/NN drew/VBD a/DT firm/JJ line/NN and/CC hewed/VBD to/TO it/PRP ,/, experts/NNS insist/VBP ./.
``/`` If/IN you/PRP have/VBP a/DT position/NN ,/, you/PRP 're/VBP better/JJR off/RP to/TO stick/VB with/IN it/PRP than/IN to/TO move/VB around/RB very/RB much/JJ ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Republican/NNP strategist/NN John/NNP Sears/NNP ./.
The/DT need/NN for/IN consistency/NN is/VBZ especially/RB acute/JJ for/IN Mr./NNP Bush/NNP ,/, who/WP ,/, Mr./NNP Sears/NNP maintains/VBZ ,/, lacks/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ ideological/JJ base/NN ./.
By/IN his/PRP$ moderate/JJ Republican/NNP heritage/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT warnings/NNS of/IN political/JJ advisers/NNS who/WP say/VBP the/DT issue/NN is/VBZ vital/JJ to/TO younger/JJR voters/NNS ,/, the/DT president/NN might/MD seem/VB to/TO have/VB at/IN least/JJS some/DT sympathy/NN with/IN abortion-rights/NNS arguments/NNS ./.
Yet/CC he/PRP is/VBZ also/RB firmly/RB bound/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ hard-line/JJ rhetoric/NN and/CC promises/NNS he/PRP made/VBD to/TO anti-abortion/JJ activists/NNS during/IN his/PRP$ long/JJ pursuit/NN of/IN the/DT White/NNP House/NNP ./.
On/IN many/JJ issues/NNS --/: flag-burning/NN ,/, for/IN instance/NN --/: his/PRP$ keen/JJ political/JJ sensitivities/NNS overcome/VBP such/JJ conflicts/NNS ./.
But/CC Mr./NNP Bush/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ advisers/NNS miscalculated/VBD the/DT politics/NNS of/IN the/DT abortion/NN issue/NN ,/, failing/VBG to/TO grasp/VB how/WRB dramatically/RB the/DT abortion-rights/NNS movement/NN would/MD be/VB aroused/VBN following/VBG last/JJ summer/NN 's/POS Supreme/NNP Court/NNP decision/NN to/TO restrict/VB those/DT rights/NNS in/IN the/DT Webster/NNP case/NN ./.
``/`` It/PRP was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT quickest/JJS changes/NNS in/IN public/JJ attitudes/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB seen/VBN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ former/JJ Reagan/NNP pollster/NN Richard/NNP Wirthlin/NNP ./.
These/DT days/NNS ,/, when/WRB others/NNS raise/VBP the/DT subject/NN of/IN abortion/NN ,/, the/DT usually/RB loquacious/JJ president/NN can/MD be/VB close-mouthed/JJ almost/RB to/TO the/DT point/NN of/IN curtness/NN ./.
Ten/CD days/NNS ago/RB he/PRP was/VBD asked/VBN to/TO amplify/VB the/DT reasons/NNS behind/IN his/PRP$ anti-abortion/JJ stance/NN ./.
``/`` My/PRP$ position/NN is/VBZ well-known/JJ and/CC well-stated/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP replied/VBD ./.
A/DT close/JJ look/NN at/IN his/PRP$ record/NN over/IN the/DT last/JJ #/CD years/NNS suggests/VBZ that/IN Mr./NNP Bush/NNP has/VBZ well-stated/VBN his/PRP$ views/NNS --/: on/IN all/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT issue/NN ./.
In/IN #/CD ,/, as/IN the/DT U.S./NNP representative/NN to/TO the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ,/, he/PRP wrote/VBD an/DT introduction/NN to/TO a/DT book/NN on/IN world/NN population/NN in/IN which/WDT he/PRP boasted/VBD of/IN his/PRP$ leadership/NN during/IN his/PRP$ term/NN in/IN Congress/NNP in/IN expanding/VBG family-planning/NN services/NNS for/IN the/DT poor/JJ ./.
Running/VBG for/IN president/NN in/IN early/JJ #/CD ,/, he/PRP was/VBD also/RB quoted/VBN as/IN supporting/VBG federal/JJ funding/NN for/IN abortions/NNS in/IN cases/NNS of/IN rape/NN ,/, incest/NN and/CC to/TO save/VB the/DT life/NN of/IN the/DT mother/NN ./.
In/IN his/PRP$ Rolling/NNP Stone/NNP interview/NN in/IN #/CD ,/, Mr./NNP Bush/NNP volunteered/VBD his/PRP$ abortion-rights/NNS remarks/NNS to/TO contrast/VB himself/PRP with/IN his/PRP$ rival/NN ,/, Ronald/NNP Reagan/NNP ./.
In/IN addition/NN to/TO supporting/VBG the/DT landmark/NN Roe/NNP vs./FW Wade/NNP Supreme/NNP Court/NNP decision/NN legalizing/VBG abortion/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Bush/NNP said/VBD he/PRP opposed/VBD the/DT constitutional/JJ ban/NN on/IN abortion/NN that/IN Mr./NNP Reagan/NNP was/VBD promising/JJ to/TO promote/VB ./.
As/IN Mr./NNP Reagan/NNP 's/POS running/NN mate/NN ,/, though/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Bush/NNP plunged/VBD headlong/RB into/IN the/DT anti-abortion/JJ position/NN ,/, endorsing/VBG a/DT constitutional/JJ amendment/NN outlawing/VBG abortion/NN ./.
He/PRP acknowledged/VBD only/RB one/CD difference/NN with/IN Mr./NNP Reagan/NNP --/: that/IN the/DT amendment/NN ought/MD to/TO have/VB exceptions/NNS for/IN rape/NN and/CC incest/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN to/TO save/VB a/DT woman/NN 's/POS life/NN ./.
Throughout/IN the/DT early/JJ #s/NNS ,/, Mr./NNP Bush/NNP was/VBD quoted/VBN sometimes/RB supporting/VBG federal/JJ funding/NN for/IN abortion/NN in/IN cases/NNS of/IN rape/NN and/CC incest/NN and/CC sometimes/RB opposing/VBG it/PRP ./.
In/IN April/NNP #/CD ,/, then-Vice/JJ President/NNP Bush/NNP had/VBD his/PRP$ staff/NN write/VB a/DT letter/NN spelling/VBG out/RP that/IN he/PRP would/MD support/VB a/DT constitutional/JJ amendment/NN banning/VBG abortions/NNS except/IN in/IN cases/NNS of/IN rape/NN ,/, incest/NN and/CC life/NN endangerment/NN ,/, but/CC that/IN he/PRP opposed/VBD federal/JJ funding/NN in/IN all/DT but/CC the/DT latter/JJ case/NN ./.
At/IN the/DT GOP/NNP convention/NN last/JJ year/NN ,/, he/PRP again/RB came/VBD out/RP for/IN an/DT amendment/NN with/IN exceptions/NNS for/IN rape/NN ,/, incest/NN and/CC life/NN endangerment/NN ./.
His/PRP$ rhetoric/NN gathered/VBD momentum/NN as/IN he/PRP rolled/VBD into/IN office/NN ,/, affirming/VBG his/PRP$ ``/`` firm/JJ support/NN of/IN our/PRP$ cause/NN ''/'' during/IN an/DT anti-abortion/JJ rally/NN three/CD days/NNS after/IN his/PRP$ inauguration/NN last/JJ January/NNP ./.
He/PRP again/RB urged/VBD passage/NN of/IN a/DT constitutional/JJ amendment/NN outlawing/VBG abortion/NN ./.
But/CC when/WRB the/DT high/JJ court/NN ruled/VBD in/IN the/DT Webster/NNP case/NN in/IN July/NNP ,/, the/DT president/NN began/VBD to/TO lower/VB the/DT volume/NN ./.
When/WRB the/DT ruling/NN was/VBD handed/VBN down/RP ,/, the/DT vacationing/VBG president/NN dispatched/VBD Chief/NNP of/IN Staff/NNP John/NNP Sununu/NNP to/TO issue/VB a/DT statement/NN and/CC refused/VBD to/TO answer/VB questions/NNS himself/PRP ./.
He/PRP did/VBD later/RB threaten/VB vetoes/NNS over/IN legislation/NN restoring/VBG the/DT District/NNP of/IN Columbia/NNP 's/POS right/NN to/TO use/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ tax/NN money/NN to/TO fund/NN abortions/NNS for/IN poor/JJ women/NNS and/CC over/IN restoring/VBG funding/NN to/TO the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS Population/NNP Fund/NNP ./.
But/CC in/IN the/DT months/NNS since/IN then/RB ,/, while/IN trying/VBG to/TO drum/VB up/RP support/NN for/IN other/JJ issues/NNS --/: such/JJ as/IN an/DT anti-flag-burning/JJ constitutional/JJ amendment/NN --/: he/PRP has/VBZ shied/VBN away/RP from/IN talking/VBG about/IN abortion/NN ./.
What/WP few/JJ comments/NNS he/PRP has/VBZ initiated/VBN have/VBP been/VBN oblique/JJ ,/, such/JJ as/IN urging/VBG ``/`` greater/JJR efforts/NNS toward/IN the/DT protection/NN of/IN human/JJ life/NN ''/'' at/IN a/DT meeting/NN of/IN Catholic/JJ lawyers/NNS in/IN Boston/NNP last/JJ month/NN ./.
