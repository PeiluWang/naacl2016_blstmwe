The/DT hottest/JJS rivalry/NN in/IN the/DT computer/NN industry/NN intensified/VBD sharply/RB yesterday/RB as/IN Digital/NNP Equipment/NNP Corp./NNP announced/VBD its/PRP$ first/JJ line/NN of/IN mainframe/NN computers/NNS ,/, targeting/VBG International/NNP Business/NNP Machines/NNPS Corp./NNP 's/POS largest/JJS market/NN ./.
IBM/NNP fired/VBD back/RP with/IN new/JJ mainframes/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, extending/VBG the/DT long-dominant/JJ #/CD line/NN with/IN a/DT #/CD %/NN to/TO #/CD %/NN power/NN boost/NN ./.
Up/IN to/TO now/RB ,/, the/DT intense/JJ competition/NN between/IN IBM/NNP and/CC Digital/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN confined/VBN largely/RB to/TO the/DT broad/JJ midrange/NN of/IN the/DT computer/NN market/NN ,/, where/WRB Digital/NNP sought/VBD to/TO exploit/VB IBM/NNP 's/POS weaknesses/NNS in/IN networking/NN ./.
But/CC Digital/NNP 's/POS move/NN into/IN mainframes/NNS will/MD target/VB IBM/NNP 's/POS home/NN turf/NN ,/, where/WRB it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT commanding/JJ #/CD %/NN share/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN ./.
Digital/NNP ,/, Maynard/NNP ,/, Mass./NNP ,/, insisted/VBD yesterday/NN that/IN its/PRP$ marketing/NN focus/NN would/MD differ/VB sharply/RB from/IN IBM/NNP 's/POS ./.
``/`` This/DT is/VBZ not/RB your/PRP$ father/NN 's/POS mainframe/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Allan/NNP McGuire/NNP ,/, a/DT Digital/NNP spokesman/NN ./.
``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT whole/JJ new/JJ generation/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.
IBM/NNP ,/, which/WDT gets/VBZ about/IN half/NN its/PRP$ revenue/NN and/CC more/JJR than/IN half/NN its/PRP$ profit/NN from/IN mainframes/NNS ,/, also/RB announced/VBD upgraded/VBN operating/NN system/NN software/NN that/IN ,/, together/RB with/IN the/DT new/JJ hardware/NN ,/, lets/VBZ customers/NNS do/VB so-called/JJ batch/NN processing/NN as/RB much/JJ as/IN #/CD %/NN faster/RBR ./.
Batch/NN processing/NN is/VBZ the/DT high-volume/JJ ,/, single-job/JJ data/NN processing/NN that/IN most/RBS mainframes/NNS typically/RB chug/VBP through/RB at/IN night/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN updating/VBG accounts/NNS at/IN banks/NNS ./.
IBM/NNP said/VBD the/DT #/CD new/JJ J/NNP and/CC JH/NNP models/NNS will/MD generally/RB be/VB available/JJ immediately/RB ,/, though/IN three/CD wo/MD n't/RB ship/VB until/IN the/DT third/JJ quarter/NN of/IN next/JJ year/NN ./.

Small/JJ models/NNS ,/, whose/WP$ performance/NN increased/VBD as/RB much/JJ as/IN #/CD %/NN ,/, will/MD carry/VB higher/JJR prices/NNS ./.
Upgrades/NNS to/TO bigger/JJR models/NNS also/RB will/MD be/VB costlier/JJR ./.
Digital/NNP 's/POS VAX/NNP #/CD mainframes/NNS ,/, which/WDT it/PRP claimed/VBD were/VBD among/IN the/DT fastest/JJS available/JJ ,/, were/VBD priced/VBN from/IN $/$ #.#/CD million/CD to/TO $/$ #.#/CD million/CD ,/, sharply/RB lower/JJR than/IN IBM/NNP models/NNS of/IN comparable/JJ power/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ models/NNS will/MD ship/VB in/IN the/DT spring/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT largest/JJS following/VBG in/IN the/DT fall/NN ./.
Analysts/NNS were/VBD disappointed/JJ that/IN Digital/NNP 's/POS new/JJ line/NN apparently/RB wo/MD n't/RB contribute/VB much/RB to/TO earnings/NNS before/IN the/DT next/JJ fiscal/JJ year/NN ,/, which/WDT begins/VBZ in/IN July/NNP ./.
Jay/NNP Stevens/NNP of/IN Dean/NNP Witter/NNP Reynolds/NNP Inc./NNP said/VBD he/PRP may/MD cut/VB his/PRP$ earnings/NNS estimate/NN for/IN the/DT current/JJ fiscal/JJ year/NN because/IN he/PRP had/VBD expected/VBN at/IN least/JJS some/DT mainframe/JJ profit/NN this/DT year/NN ./.
But/CC he/PRP added/VBD that/IN he/PRP expected/VBD to/TO raise/VB his/PRP$ estimate/NN for/IN fiscal/JJ #/CD at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./.
After/IN the/DT announcement/NN yesterday/NN ,/, Digital/NNP shares/NNS gained/VBD $/$ #.#/CD to/TO close/VB at/IN $/$ #.#/CD in/IN New/NNP York/NNP Stock/NNP Exchange/NNP composite/JJ trading/NN ./.

Analysts/NNS have/VBP predicted/VBN strong/JJ pent-up/JJ demand/NN for/IN the/DT new/JJ line/NN among/IN Digital/NNP 's/POS customers/NNS ./.
Large/JJ Digital/NNP buyers/NNS say/VBP the/DT new/JJ VAX/NNP will/MD let/VB them/PRP stay/VB with/IN Digital/NNP when/WRB they/PRP need/VBP the/DT power/NN of/IN a/DT mainframe/NN ,/, instead/RB of/IN turning/VBG to/TO IBM/NNP ./.
``/`` I/PRP 'm/VBP convinced/JJ there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ market/NN for/IN this/DT machine/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Stephen/NNP Smith/NNP of/IN PaineWebber/NNP Inc/NNP ./.
Digital/NNP also/RB plans/VBZ to/TO compete/VB fiercely/RB with/IN IBM/NNP when/WRB the/DT giant/NN 's/POS customers/NNS are/VBP computerizing/VBG new/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ businesses/NNS ./.
Digital/NNP ,/, however/RB ,/, does/VBZ n't/RB expect/VB to/TO displace/VB IBM/NNP mainframes/NNS that/WDT are/VBP already/RB installed/VBN at/IN big/JJ companies/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN to/TO commercial/JJ markets/NNS ,/, Digital/NNP 's/POS new/JJ line/NN targets/VBZ the/DT low/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT engineering/NN and/CC scientific/JJ supercomputer/NN market/NN ,/, when/WRB it/PRP 's/VBZ packaged/VBN with/IN an/DT optional/JJ supercharger/NN ,/, known/VBN as/IN a/DT vector/NN processor/NN ./.
Digital/NNP 's/POS push/NN into/IN mainframes/NNS comes/VBZ at/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB its/PRP$ mainstay/NN minicomputer/NN line/NN is/VBZ under/IN growing/VBG pressure/NN from/IN smaller/JJR personal/JJ computers/NNS and/CC workstations/NNS that/WDT operate/VBP on/IN standard/JJ operating/VBG systems/NNS rather/RB than/IN on/IN the/DT proprietary/JJ systems/NNS that/IN older/JJR minicomputers/NNS use/VBP ./.
Although/IN Digital/NNP has/VBZ staked/VBN out/RP a/DT major/JJ presence/NN in/IN the/DT booming/VBG workstation/NN market/NN ,/, profit/NN margins/NNS in/IN that/DT market/NN are/VBP much/RB slimmer/JJR than/IN for/IN mainframes/NNS ./.

IBM/NNP 's/POS mainframe/NN sales/NNS have/VBP held/VBN up/RP better/RBR than/IN expected/VBN this/DT year/NN ,/, with/IN analysts/NNS estimating/VBG they/PRP have/VBP risen/VBN #/CD %/NN to/TO #/CD %/NN ./.

IBM/NNP ,/, Armonk/NNP ,/, N.Y./NNP ,/, said/VBD it/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO bring/VB out/RP the/DT mainframes/NNS as/RB soon/RB as/IN it/PRP could/MD to/TO spark/VB as/IN many/JJ sales/NNS as/IN possible/JJ by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN ./.
