Another/DT reason/NN :/: Emboldened/VBN by/IN their/PRP$ success/NN in/IN helping/VBG to/TO scuttle/VB the/DT previous/JJ transaction/NN ,/, the/DT machinists/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO be/VB more/RBR aggressive/JJ if/IN a/DT second/JJ buy-out/NN attempt/NN occurs/VBZ ./.

At/IN the/DT very/RB least/JJS ,/, the/DT pilots/NNS want/VBP some/DT form/NN of/IN control/NN over/IN the/DT airline/NN ,/, perhaps/RB through/IN super-majority/NN voting/NN rights/NNS ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT machinists/NNS have/VBP always/RB opposed/VBN majority/NN ownership/NN in/IN principle/NN ,/, saying/VBG they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB employees/NNS should/MD be/VB owners/NNS ./.
