The/DT bad/JJ news/NN in/IN the/DT junk/NN bond/NN market/NN yesterday/RB was/VBD that/IN TW/NNP Services/NNPS ,/, a/DT group/NN of/IN restaurant/NN chains/NNS ,/, became/VBD the/DT latest/JJS prospective/JJ issuer/NN to/TO get/VB a/DT cold/JJ shoulder/NN from/IN bond/NN buyers/NNS ./.
The/DT good/JJ news/NN --/: to/TO fans/NNS of/IN stable/JJ credit/NN ,/, at/IN least/JJS --/: is/VBZ what/WP the/DT rejection/NN says/VBZ about/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN mind/NN of/IN junk/NN buyers/NNS ./.
Apparently/RB they/PRP are/VBP learning/VBG to/TO say/VB no/UH to/TO excess/JJ risk/NN ./.
Coniston/NNP Partners/NNPS ,/, which/WDT with/IN related/JJ entities/NNS controls/VBZ #/CD %/NN of/IN TW/NNP ,/, had/VBD been/VBN planning/VBG to/TO sell/VB $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD of/IN junk/NN bonds/NNS ,/, among/IN other/JJ things/NNS to/TO finance/VB their/PRP$ acquisition/NN of/IN the/DT remaining/VBG public/JJ shares/NNS ./.
But/CC Coniston/NNP ,/, a/DT New/NNP York/NNP partnership/NN managed/VBN by/IN the/DT firm/NN of/IN Gollust/NNP ,/, Tierney/NNP &/CC Oliver/NNP ,/, yesterday/NN announced/VBD that/IN ``/`` in/IN view/NN of/IN unsettled/JJ conditions/NNS in/IN securities/NNS markets/NNS ''/'' the/DT offering/NN would/MD be/VB postponed/VBN and/CC restructured/VBN ./.
What/WP was/VBD n't/RB mentioned/VBN is/VBZ that/IN Coniston/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ investment/NN banker/NN ,/, Donaldson/NNP ,/, Lufkin/NNP &/CC Jenrette/NNP ,/, just/RB completed/VBN a/DT two-week/JJ ``/`` road/NN show/NN ''/'' for/IN the/DT purpose/NN of/IN marketing/VBG the/DT bonds/NNS ./.
And/CC investors/NNS ,/, at/IN least/JJS for/IN now/RB ,/, took/VBD a/DT pass/NN ./.
TW/NNP 's/POS junk/NN bonds/NNS were/VBD n't/RB ,/, as/IN junk/NN bonds/NNS go/VB ,/, unusually/RB weak/JJ ./.
Its/PRP$ fast-food/NN restaurants/NNS --/: including/VBG Denny/NNP 's/POS ,/, Hardee/NNP 's/POS ,/, Quincy/NNP 's/POS and/CC El/NNP Pollo/NNP Loco/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- ``/`` the/NN only/JJ significant/JJ fast-food/NN chain/NN to/TO specialize/VB in/IN char-broiled/JJ chicken/NN ''/'' -RRB-/-RRB- --/: are/VBP stable/JJ ,/, recession-resistant/JJ and/CC growing/VBG ./.
But/CC unless/IN they/PRP continued/VBD to/TO grow/VB ,/, TW/NNP ,/, based/VBN in/IN Paramus/NNP ,/, N.J./NNP ,/, would/MD have/VB run/VBN into/IN trouble/NN ./.
Until/IN recently/RB ,/, such/JJ buy-now/JJ ,/, pray-for-growth-later/JJ deals/NNS were/VBD routine/JJ ./.
``/`` But/CC people/NNS do/VBP n't/RB buy/VB anything/NN on/IN expectation/NN anymore/RB ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Jack/NNP Utter/NNP ,/, who/WP manages/VBZ the/DT high-yield/JJ fund/NN of/IN IDS/NNP Financial/NNP Services/NNPS ./.
``/`` Investors/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP adds/VBZ ,/, ``/`` are/VBP getting/VBG religion/NN ./. ''/''
The/DT TW/NNP buy-out/NN may/MD yet/RB be/VB financed/VBN ./.
``/`` There/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN wrong/JJ with/IN the/DT company/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Coniston/NN principal/NN Paul/NNP Tierney/NNP ./.
The/DT rub/NN ,/, he/PRP says/VBZ ,/, is/VBZ that/IN ``/`` the/DT junk/NN market/NN is/VBZ n't/RB as/RB deep/JJ ''/'' as/IN before/RB ./.
TW/NNP 's/POS stockholder/NN meeting/NN was/VBD postponed/VBN from/IN tomorrow/NN to/TO Nov./NNP #/CD ./.
By/IN then/RB ,/, DLJ/NNP hopes/VBZ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO sell/VB less-junky/JJR junk/NN bonds/NNS ./.
Gollust/NNP ,/, Tierney/NNP &/CC Oliver/NNP is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO contribute/VB more/JJR than/IN the/DT $/$ #/CD million/CD in/IN equity/NN it/PRP had/VBD planned/VBN on/RB ./.
Banks/NNS may/MD contribute/VB more/JJR senior/JJ debt/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT total/JJ amount/NN of/IN junk/NN financing/NN will/MD be/VB reduced/VBN ./.
A/DT DLJ/NNP banker/NN ,/, putting/VBG a/DT best/JJS possible/JJ face/NN on/IN it/PRP ,/, asserts/VBZ that/IN ``/`` very/RB few/JJ people/NNS said/VBD they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB like/IN the/DT credit/NN quality/NN ./.
People/NNS said/VBD they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB a/DT billion-dollar/JJ deal/NN would/MD trade/VB ./. ''/''
But/CC trading/NN risk/NN stems/VBZ from/IN credit/NN risk/NN ./.
And/CC by/IN adding/VBG equity/NN ,/, DLJ/NNP would/MD seem/VB to/TO be/VB acknowledging/VBG that/DT credit/NN risk/NN was/VBD a/DT concern/NN ./.
Indeed/RB ,/, the/DT DLJ/NNP banker/NN says/VBZ ,/, in/IN the/DT reborn/JJ capital/NN structure/NN cash/NN coverage/NN of/IN interest/NN ``/`` will/MD meaningfully/RB improve/VB ./. ''/''
As/IN he/PRP sums/VBZ it/PRP up/RP :/: ``/`` We/PRP are/VBP listening/VBG to/TO the/DT market/NN ./. ''/''
What/WP is/VBZ it/PRP ,/, to/TO borrow/VB a/DT term/NN from/IN Coniston/NNP ,/, that/WDT so/RB unsettled/VBD the/DT market/NN ?/.
Some/DT of/IN the/DT same/JJ risks/NNS that/WDT were/VBD cited/VBN --/: and/CC seemingly/RB ignored/VBN --/: in/IN dozens/NNS of/IN previous/JJ junk/NN offerings/NNS ./.
The/DT TW/NNP prospectus/NN says/VBZ that/IN if/IN the/DT acquisition/NN had/VBD been/VBN completed/VBN earlier/RBR ,/, pretax/JJ earnings/NNS ``/`` would/MD have/VB been/VBN insufficient/JJ to/TO cover/VB its/PRP$ fixed/JJ charges/NNS ,/, including/VBG interest/NN on/IN debt/NN securities/NNS ,/, ''/'' by/IN approximately/RB $/$ #.#/CD million/CD in/IN the/DT first/JJ six/CD months/NNS of/IN #/CD ./.
TW/NNP notes/VBZ ,/, as/IN many/JJ junk/NN issuers/NNS do/VBP ,/, that/IN ``/`` adjusted/VBN to/TO eliminate/VB non-cash/JJ charges/NNS ''/'' TW/NNP would/MD have/VB run/VBN a/DT cash/NN surplus/NN --/: in/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, of/IN $/$ #/CD million/CD over/IN six/CD months/NNS ./.
But/CC such/JJ calculations/NNS ignore/VBP the/DT noncash/JJ charge/NN of/IN depreciation/NN ,/, taken/VBN to/TO allow/VB for/IN the/DT gradual/JJ wearing/VBG out/RB of/IN french/JJ friers/NNS ,/, deterioration/NN of/IN stores/NNS and/CC the/DT like/JJ ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, DLJ/NNP says/VBZ ,/, the/DT company/NN envisions/VBZ capital/NN expenses/NNS of/IN about/IN $/$ #/CD million/CD a/DT year/NN ./.
TW/NNP 's/POS pitch/NN was/VBD that/IN sales/NNS and/CC earnings/NNS at/IN its/PRP$ restaurants/NNS have/VBP risen/VBN steadily/RB and/CC that/IN people/NNS wo/MD n't/RB stop/VB eating/VBG during/IN a/DT downturn/NN ./.
But/CC they/PRP wo/MD n't/RB necessarily/RB eat/VB at/IN Denny/NNP 's/POS ./.
The/DT fast-food/JJ business/NN is/VBZ ``/`` intensely/RB competitive/JJ ,/, ''/'' notes/VBZ Wertheim/NNP Schroder/NNP analyst/NN John/NNP Rohs/NNP ./.
Prospective/JJ bond/NN buyers/NNS noted/VBD that/IN TW/NNP historically/RB has/VBZ prospered/VBN because/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN willing/JJ to/TO spend/VB aggressively/RB on/IN remodeling/VBG restaurants/NNS and/CC redoing/VBG menus/NNS ./.
``/`` We/PRP were/VBD concerned/VBN that/IN they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB going/VBG to/TO generate/VB enough/JJ cash/NN for/IN capital/NN spending/NN and/CC also/RB to/TO pay/VB down/RP debt/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ a/DT big/JJ investor/NN in/IN high-yield/JJ debt/NN ./.
DLJ/NNP argues/VBZ that/IN TW/NNP could/MD ,/, if/IN necessary/JJ ,/, cut/VB capital/NN spending/NN ,/, since/IN half/NN of/IN what/WP it/PRP plans/VBZ to/TO spend/VB is/VBZ for/IN ``/`` growth/NN ,/, ''/'' rather/RB than/IN maintenance/NN ./.
But/CC investors/NNS noted/VBD that/IN under/IN the/DT shelved/JJ offering/NN ,/, TW/NNP would/MD have/VB needed/VBN to/TO grow/VB to/TO meet/VB its/PRP$ debt/NN payments/NNS ./.
Its/PRP$ calculations/NNS for/IN meeting/VBG cash/NN charges/NNS ignore/VBP $/$ #/CD million/CD a/DT year/NN in/IN interest/NN on/IN cash-deferred/JJ ,/, or/CC zero-coupon/JJ debentures/NNS --/: which/WDT ultimately/RB would/MD have/VB had/VBD to/TO be/VB paid/VBN ./.
The/DT prospectus/NN notes/VBZ ``/`` there/EX can/MD be/VB no/DT assurance/NN ''/'' that/IN future/JJ growth/NN will/MD continue/VB at/IN past/JJ levels/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT recent/JJ past/NN ,/, bond/NN buyers/NNS did/VBD n't/RB seek/VB such/JJ assurance/NN ./.
