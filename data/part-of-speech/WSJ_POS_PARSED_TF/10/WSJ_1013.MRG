For/IN the/DT quarter/NN a/DT year/NN ago/RB ,/, Columbia/NNP reported/VBD earnings/NNS of/IN $/$ #.#/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC #/CD cents/NNS a/DT share/NN ./.

The/DT loss/NN stems/VBZ from/IN $/$ #.#/CD million/CD of/IN write-downs/NNS on/IN Columbia/NNP 's/POS $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD high-yield/JJ investment/NN securities/NNS portfolio/NN ,/, which/WDT includes/VBZ about/IN $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD of/IN junk/NN bonds/NNS ,/, $/$ #/CD million/CD of/IN preferred/JJ stock/NN ,/, and/CC Treasury/NNP securities/NNS ./.
Columbia/NNP owes/VBZ its/PRP$ spectacular/JJ growth/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS to/TO its/PRP$ junk-bond/NN portfolio/NN ,/, the/DT largest/JJS of/IN any/DT U.S./NNP thrift/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT nine/CD months/NNS ,/, losses/NNS totaled/VBD $/$ #/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC $/$ #.#/CD a/DT share/NN ,/, compared/VBN with/IN net/JJ income/NN of/IN $/$ #.#/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC $/$ #.#/CD a/DT share/NN ,/, a/DT year/NN earlier/RB ./.

On/IN June/NNP #/CD ,/, loss/NN reserves/NNS stood/VBD at/IN $/$ #.#/CD million/CD ./.

Because/IN Columbia/NNP now/RB must/MD sell/VB the/DT bonds/NNS within/IN five/CD years/NNS ,/, accounting/NN rules/NNS require/VBP the/DT thrift/NN to/TO value/VB the/DT bonds/NNS at/IN the/DT lower/JJR of/IN cost/NN or/CC market/NN prices/NNS ./.
For/IN its/PRP$ future/NN strategy/NN ,/, Columbia/NNP officials/NNS said/VBD the/DT thrift/NN may/MD branch/VB out/RP into/IN commercial/JJ lending/NN or/CC managing/NN outside/JJ investments/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN beefing/VBG up/RP more/RBR traditional/JJ thrift/NN activities/NNS ./.
