If/IN a/DT TV/NN weatherman/NN gets/VBZ butterflies/NNS facing/VBG the/DT camera/NN again/RB after/IN a/DT questionable/JJ forecast/NN ,/, Donald/NNP H./NNP Straszheim/NNP surely/RB understands/VBZ ./.
The/DT chief/NN economist/NN of/IN Merrill/NNP Lynch/NNP &/CC Co./NNP finds/VBZ himself/PRP in/IN such/PDT a/DT position/NN as/IN he/PRP buzzes/VBZ the/DT Midwest/NN on/IN his/PRP$ first/JJ road/NN trip/NN since/IN backpedaling/VBG on/IN a/DT major/JJ prediction/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Straszheim/NNP expects/VBZ he/PRP will/MD take/VB some/DT heat/NN ,/, and/CC he/PRP 's/VBZ right/JJ ./.
Since/IN the/DT last/JJ time/NN he/PRP traveled/VBD this/DT way/NN several/JJ months/NNS ago/IN ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ recanted/VBN a/DT series/NN of/IN bold/JJ forecasts/NNS of/IN a/DT recession/NN ./.
In/IN February/NNP #/CD ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, Merrill/NNP Lynch/NNP 's/POS weekly/JJ commentary/NN announced/VBD that/IN ``/`` the/DT economy/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO fall/VB into/IN recession/NN in/IN early/JJ #/CD ./. ''/''
The/DT forecasts/NNS were/VBD widely/RB disseminated/VBN ,/, and/CC ,/, in/IN a/DT splashy/JJ ad/NN campaign/NN launched/VBN in/IN the/DT summer/NN of/IN #/CD ,/, Merrill/NNP Lynch/NNP urged/VBD investors/NNS to/TO buy/VB bonds/NNS ./.

The/DT firm/NN also/RB raised/VBD the/DT percentage/NN of/IN bonds/NNS in/IN its/PRP$ model/NN portfolio/NN from/IN #/CD %/NN to/TO #/CD %/NN and/CC later/RB to/TO #/CD %/NN ./.
But/CC this/DT September/NNP --/: just/RB when/WRB many/JJ market/NN economists/NNS ,/, including/VBG some/DT at/IN Merrill/NNP Lynch/NNP ,/, believed/VBD that/IN Mr./NNP Straszheim/NNP was/VBD about/IN to/TO be/VB proved/VBN right/RB --/: he/PRP took/VBD a/DT detour/NN if/IN not/RB a/DT U-turn/NN ./.

And/CC ,/, just/RB recently/RB ,/, Merrill/NNP Lynch/NNP cut/VBD the/DT recommended/VBN bondholdings/NNS back/RB to/TO #/CD %/NN ./.
While/IN such/JJ changes/NNS might/MD sound/VB minor/JJ ,/, they/PRP are/VBP n't/RB :/: Merrill/NNP Lynch/NNP manages/VBZ or/CC oversees/VBZ some/DT $/$ #/CD billion/CD in/IN retail/JJ accounts/NNS that/WDT include/VBP everything/NN from/IN mutual/JJ funds/NNS to/TO individual/JJ annuities/NNS ./.

Mr./NNP Shilling/NNP ,/, who/WP was/VBD Merrill/NNP Lynch/NNP 's/POS chief/NN economist/NN from/IN #/CD to/TO #/CD ,/, has/VBZ heralded/VBN a/DT recession/NN for/IN months/NNS ./.
``/`` My/PRP$ own/JJ personal/JJ opinion/NN is/VBZ that/IN Don/NNP threw/VBD in/IN the/DT towel/NN just/RB about/IN the/DT time/NN he/PRP should/MD have/VB doubled/VBN his/PRP$ bet/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP says/VBZ ./.
