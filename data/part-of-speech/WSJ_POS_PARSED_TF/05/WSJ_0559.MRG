Out/IN of/IN the/DT mouths/NNS of/IN revolutionaries/NNS are/VBP coming/VBG words/NNS of/IN moderation/NN ./.
Here/RB ,/, at/IN a/DT soccer/NN stadium/NN near/IN the/DT black/JJ township/NN of/IN Soweto/NNP yesterday/NN ,/, were/VBD eight/CD leaders/NNS of/IN the/DT African/NNP National/NNP Congress/NNP ,/, seven/CD of/IN whom/WP had/VBD spent/VBN most/JJS of/IN their/PRP$ adult/NN lives/NNS in/IN prison/NN for/IN sabotage/NN and/CC conspiracy/NN to/TO overthrow/VB the/DT government/NN ./.
Here/RB were/VBD more/JJR than/IN #,#/CD ANC/NNP supporters/NNS ,/, gathering/VBG for/IN the/DT first/JJ ANC/NNP rally/NN inside/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP since/IN the/DT black/JJ liberation/NN movement/NN was/VBD banned/VBN in/IN #/CD ./.
Here/RB was/VBD the/DT state/NN security/NN appartus/NN poised/VBN to/TO pounce/VB on/IN any/DT words/NNS or/CC acts/NNS of/IN provocation/NN ,/, let/VB alone/JJ revolution/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT words/NNS that/WDT boomed/VBD over/IN the/DT loudspeakers/NNS bore/VBD messages/NNS of/IN peace/NN ,/, unity/NN ,/, negotiation/NN and/CC discipline/NN ./.
``/`` We/PRP stand/VBP for/IN peace/NN today/NN and/CC we/PRP will/MD stand/VB for/IN peace/NN tomorrow/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Walter/NNP Sisulu/NNP ,/, the/DT ANC/NNP 's/POS former/JJ secretary/NN general/NN who/WP ,/, along/IN with/IN five/CD of/IN his/PRP$ colleagues/NNS ,/, served/VBD #/CD years/NNS in/IN prison/NN before/IN being/VBG released/VBN two/CD weeks/NNS ago/IN ./.
Some/DT members/NNS of/IN the/DT huge/JJ crowd/NN shouted/VBD ``/`` Viva/FW peace/NN ,/, viva/FW ./. ''/''
These/DT are/VBP curious/JJ times/NNS in/IN South/JJ African/JJ politics/NNS ./.
The/DT government/NN and/CC the/DT ANC/NNP ,/, the/DT bitterest/JJS of/IN enemies/NNS ,/, are/VBP engaged/VBN in/IN an/DT elaborate/JJ mating/NN dance/NN designed/VBN to/TO entice/VB each/DT other/JJ to/TO the/DT negotiating/VBG table/NN ./.
Pretoria/NN releases/VBZ the/DT ANC/NNP leaders/NNS ,/, most/JJS of/IN whom/WP were/VBD serving/VBG life/NN sentences/NNS ,/, and/CC allows/VBZ them/PRP to/TO speak/VB freely/RB ,/, hoping/VBG that/IN the/DT ANC/NNP will/MD abandon/VB its/PRP$ use/NN of/IN violence/NN ./.
The/DT ANC/NNP leaders/NNS speak/VBP in/IN tones/NNS of/IN moderation/NN ,/, emphasizing/VBG discipline/NN ,/, hoping/VBG the/DT government/NN will/MD be/VB encouraged/VBN to/TO take/VB further/JJ steps/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN freeing/VBG Nelson/NNP Mandela/NNP ,/, the/DT most/RBS prominent/JJ ANC/NNP figure/NN ,/, and/CC unbanning/VBG the/DT organization/NN ./.
The/DT government/NN of/IN President/NNP F.W./NNP de/NNP Klerk/NNP is/VBZ using/VBG this/DT situation/NN to/TO improve/VB its/PRP$ international/JJ image/NN and/CC head/VB off/RP further/JJ economic/JJ sanctions/NNS ./.
Meanwhile/RB ,/, the/DT many/JJ organizations/NNS inside/IN the/DT country/NN that/WDT back/VBP the/DT ANC/NNP are/VBP taking/VBG the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO regain/VB their/PRP$ strength/NN and/CC mobilize/VB their/PRP$ supporters/NNS even/RB though/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN emergency/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ severely/RB curtailed/VBN black/JJ opposition/NN ,/, remains/VBZ in/IN force/NN ./.
The/DT result/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT unthinkable/JJ and/CC illogical/JJ are/VBP happening/VBG ./.
Six/CD months/NNS ago/IN ,/, government/NN approval/NN for/IN an/DT ANC/NNP rally/NN was/VBD inconceivable/JJ ./.
Equally/RB inconceivable/JJ is/VBZ that/IN the/DT ANC/NNP ,/, given/VBN the/DT chance/NN to/TO hold/VB a/DT rally/NN ,/, would/MD extend/VB a/DT hand/NN ,/, albeit/IN warily/RB ,/, to/TO the/DT government/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT message/NN read/VBN out/RP at/IN the/DT rally/NN ,/, exiled/VBD ANC/NNP President/NNP Oliver/NNP Tambo/NNP ,/, who/WP ca/MD n't/RB legally/RB be/VB quoted/VBN in/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP ,/, said/VBD the/DT country/NN was/VBD at/IN a/DT crossroads/NNS and/CC that/IN Mr./NNP de/NNP Klerk/NNP ``/`` may/MD yet/RB earn/VB a/DT place/NN among/IN the/DT peacemakers/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ country/NN ''/'' if/IN he/PRP chooses/VBZ a/DT ``/`` path/NN of/IN genuine/JJ political/JJ settlement/NN ./. ''/''
Still/RB ,/, this/DT does/VBZ n't/RB mean/VB that/IN either/CC the/DT government/NN or/CC the/DT ANC/NNP is/VBZ changing/VBG stripes/NNS --/: or/CC that/IN either/DT has/VBZ moved/VBN significantly/RB closer/RBR to/TO the/DT other/JJ ./.
The/DT government/NN may/MD ease/VB repression/NN in/IN some/DT areas/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP still/RB keeps/VBZ a/DT tight/JJ grip/NN in/IN others/NNS ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, it/PRP releases/VBZ Mr./NNP Sisulu/NNP without/IN conditions/NNS ,/, yet/RB his/PRP$ son/NN ,/, Zwelakhe/NNP ,/, a/DT newspaper/NN editor/NN ,/, is/VBZ restricted/VBN to/TO his/PRP$ home/NN much/RB of/IN the/DT day/NN and/CC is/VBZ n't/RB allowed/VBN to/TO work/VB as/IN a/DT journalist/NN ./.
The/DT ANC/NNP vows/VBZ to/TO keep/VB up/RP pressure/NN on/IN the/DT government/NN ./.
Speakers/NNS yesterday/NN called/VBD on/IN foreign/JJ governments/NNS to/TO increase/VB sanctions/NNS against/IN Pretoria/NN and/CC urged/VBD supporters/NNS inside/IN the/DT country/NN to/TO continue/VB defying/VBG emergency/NN restrictions/NNS and/CC racial/JJ segregation/NN ,/, known/VBN as/IN apartheid/NN ./.
``/`` We/PRP can/MD not/RB wait/VB on/IN the/DT government/NN to/TO make/VB changes/NNS at/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ pace/NN ,/, ''/'' Mr./NNP Sisulu/NNP said/VBD ./.
Because/IN the/DT ANC/NNP remains/VBZ banned/VBN ,/, both/PDT the/DT government/NN ,/, which/WDT approved/VBD the/DT rally/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT organizers/NNS ,/, who/WP orchestrated/VBD it/PRP ,/, denied/VBD it/PRP was/VBD an/DT ANC/NNP rally/NN ./.
They/PRP both/DT called/VBD it/PRP a/DT ``/`` welcome/JJ home/NN ''/'' gathering/NN ./.
Nevertheless/RB ,/, an/DT ANC/NNP rally/NN by/IN any/DT other/JJ name/NN is/VBZ still/RB an/DT ANC/NNP rally/NN ./.
The/DT recently/RB released/VBN leaders/NNS sat/VBD high/RB atop/IN a/DT podium/NN in/IN one/CD section/NN of/IN the/DT stadium/NN stands/NNS ./.
Behind/IN them/PRP was/VBD a/DT huge/JJ ANC/NNP flag/NN and/CC an/DT even/RB bigger/JJR sign/NN that/WDT said/VBD ``/`` ANC/NNP Lives/VBZ ,/, ANC/NNP Leads/VBZ ./. ''/''
Next/JJ to/TO them/PRP was/VBD the/DT red/JJ flag/NN of/IN the/DT outlawed/VBN South/NNP African/NNP Communist/NNP Party/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ long/RB been/VBN an/DT ANC/NNP ally/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT stands/NNS ,/, people/NNS waved/VBD ANC/NNP flags/NNS ,/, wore/VBD ANC/NNP T-shirts/NNS ,/, sang/VBD ANC/NNP songs/NNS and/CC chanted/VBD ANC/NNP slogans/NNS ./.
``/`` Today/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Mr./NNP Sisulu/NNP ,/, ``/`` the/DT ANC/NNP has/VBZ captured/VBN the/DT center/NN stage/NN of/IN political/JJ life/NN in/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP ./. ''/''
As/IN a/DT police/NN helicopter/NN circled/VBD overhead/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Sisulu/NNP repeated/VBD the/DT ANC/NNP 's/POS demands/NNS on/IN the/DT government/NN to/TO create/VB a/DT climate/NN for/IN negotiations/NNS :/: Release/VB all/DT political/JJ prisoners/NNS unconditionally/RB ;/: lift/VB all/DT bans/NNS and/CC restrictions/NNS on/IN individuals/NNS and/CC organizations/NNS ;/: remove/VB all/DT troops/NNS from/IN the/DT black/JJ townships/NNS ;/: end/VB the/DT state/NN of/IN emergency/NN ,/, and/CC cease/VB all/DT political/JJ trials/NNS and/CC political/JJ executions/NNS ./.
If/IN these/DT conditions/NNS are/VBP met/VBN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, the/DT ANC/NNP would/MD be/VB prepared/VBN to/TO discuss/VB suspending/VBG its/PRP$ guerrilla/NN activities/NNS ./.
``/`` There/EX can/MD be/VB no/DT question/NN of/IN us/PRP unilaterally/RB abandoning/VBG the/DT armed/VBN struggle/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./. ``/``
To/TO date/NN ,/, we/PRP see/VBP no/DT clear/JJ indication/NN that/IN the/DT government/NN is/VBZ serious/JJ about/IN negotiations/NNS ./.
All/PDT their/PRP$ utterances/NNS are/VBP vague/JJ ./. ''/''
Echoing/VBG a/DT phrase/NN from/IN Mr./NNP de/NNP Klerk/NNP ,/, Mr./NNP Sisulu/NNP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` Let/VB all/DT of/IN us/PRP who/WP love/VBP this/DT country/NN engage/VB in/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN building/VBG a/DT new/JJ South/NNP Africa/NNP ./.
