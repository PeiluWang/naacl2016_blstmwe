After/IN days/NNS of/IN intense/JJ but/CC fruitless/JJ negotiations/NNS ,/, a/DT federal/JJ judge/NN last/JJ week/NN threatened/VBD to/TO convert/VB William/NNP Herbert/NNP Hunt/NNP 's/POS Chapter/NN #/CD personal/JJ bankruptcy/NN case/NN into/IN a/DT Chapter/NN #/CD liquidation/NN ./.

While/IN admitting/VBG such/PDT a/DT move/NN would/MD be/VB ``/`` devastating/VBG ''/'' to/TO most/JJS creditors/NNS ,/, Judge/NNP Abramson/NNP told/VBD a/DT courtroom/NN filled/VBN with/IN nearly/RB two/CD dozen/NN attorneys/NNS that/IN he/PRP was/VBD concerned/VBN about/IN the/DT toll/NN mounting/VBG legal/JJ bills/NNS will/MD take/VB on/IN Mr./NNP Hunt/NNP 's/POS shrinking/VBG estate/NN and/CC about/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, following/VBG voting/NN by/IN creditors/NNS ,/, none/NN of/IN the/DT reorganization/NN plans/NNS appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB viable/JJ in/IN their/PRP$ present/JJ form/NN ./.

Under/IN Chapter/NN #/CD of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Bankruptcy/NNP Code/NNP ,/, a/DT company/NN continues/VBZ to/TO operate/VB under/IN protection/NN from/IN creditors/NNS '/POS lawsuits/NNS while/IN it/PRP works/VBZ out/RP a/DT plan/NN to/TO pay/VB its/PRP$ debts/NNS ./.
Under/IN Chapter/NN #/CD ,/, the/DT assets/NNS of/IN a/DT company/NN are/VBP sold/VBN off/RP to/TO pay/VB creditors/NNS ./.
Despite/IN his/PRP$ reluctance/NN to/TO take/VB the/DT latter/JJ step/NN ,/, the/DT judge/NN indicated/VBD he/PRP would/MD move/VB quickly/RB after/IN hearing/VBG testimony/NN later/RB this/DT week/NN in/IN the/DT bitter/JJ dispute/NN between/IN Manufacturers/NNPS Hanover/NNP Trust/NNP Co./NNP and/CC Minpeco/NNP S.A./NNP ,/, a/DT minerals/NNS concern/NN owned/VBN by/IN the/DT Peruvian/JJ governmemt/NN ./.

But/CC even/RB that/DT is/VBZ disputed/VBN by/IN Manufacturers/NNPS Hanover/NNP which/WDT ,/, in/IN alliance/NN with/IN the/DT IRS/NNP ,/, contends/VBZ that/IN Minpeco/NNP has/VBZ already/RB collected/VBN more/JJR than/IN its/PRP$ actual/JJ damages/NNS from/IN other/JJ defendants/NNS in/IN the/DT silver-conspiracy/NN case/NN ./.
