But/CC in/IN the/DT end/NN his/PRP$ resignation/NN as/IN Chancellor/NNP of/IN the/DT Exchequer/NNP may/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ thing/NN ,/, especially/RB if/IN it/PRP works/VBZ as/IN he/PRP no/DT doubt/NN intends/VBZ --/: by/IN forcing/VBG Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Thatcher/NNP and/CC her/PRP$ counterparts/NNS elsewhere/RB to/TO confront/VB the/DT genuine/JJ intellectual/JJ issues/NNS involved/VBN ./.

The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN on/IN the/DT vital/JJ issue/NN of/IN monetary/JJ policy/NN and/CC exchange/NN rates/NNS ,/, conservative/JJ ,/, free-market/JJ economists/NNS divide/VBP into/IN at/IN least/JJS three/CD incompatible/JJ camps/NNS ./.

And/CC there/EX are/VBP the/DT twin-deficit/NN Keynesians/NNPS ,/, who/WP predict$$advocate/VBP devaluations/NNS to/TO balance/VB trade/NN flows/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT problem/NN not/RB only/RB for/IN Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Thatcher/NNP but/CC for/IN President/NNP Bush/NNP ,/, as/IN shown/VBN in/IN the/DT ongoing/JJ bickering/NN over/IN the/DT dollar/NN between/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP and/CC the/DT Mulford/NNP Treasury/NNP ./.
In/IN the/DT British/JJ case/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP is/VBZ the/DT closest/JJS thing/NN in/IN London/NNP to/TO a/DT supply-side/JJ globalist/NN ./.
He/PRP not/RB only/RB slashed/VBD marginal/JJ tax/NN rates/NNS ,/, initially/RB sparking/VBG fresh/JJ growth/NN in/IN Britain/NNP ,/, but/CC he/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO regulate/VB monetary/JJ policy/NN by/IN targeting/VBG exchange/NN rates/NNS ,/, indeed/RB joining/VBG the/DT European/NNP Monetary/NNP System/NNP ./.
While/IN no/DT doubt/NN agreeing/VBG with/IN Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP on/IN everything/NN else/RB ,/, Sir/NNP Alan/NNP is/VBZ a/DT dyed-in-the-wool/JJ monetarist/NN ,/, inclined/VBN to/TO defend/VB floating/VBG rates/NNS to/TO the/DT death/NN ./.
To/TO make/VB matters/NNS even/RB more/RBR confusing/JJ ,/, the/DT earlier/JJR U.S./NNP experience/NN made/VBD clear/JJ that/IN Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP 's/POS tax/NN cuts/NNS would/MD have/VB profound/JJ effects/NNS on/IN Britain/NNP 's/POS international/JJ accounts/NNS and/CC the/DT value/NN of/IN sterling/NN ./.
They/PRP increased/VBD the/DT after-tax/JJ rate/NN of/IN return/NN and/CC made/VBD Britain/NNP a/DT far/RB more/RBR attractive/JJ place/NN to/TO invest/VB ,/, producing/VBG sudden/JJ capital/NN inflows/NNS ./.
By/IN accounting/VBG definitions/NNS ,/, this/DT had/VBD to/TO produce/VB a/DT sudden/JJ trade/NN deficit/NN ./.
As/IN in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ,/, it/PRP also/RB produced/VBD a/DT sudden/JJ burst/NN in/IN the/DT demand/NN for/IN sterling/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ a/DT surge/NN in/IN the/DT sterling/NN monetary/JJ aggregates/NNS ,/, M-Whatever/NN ./.
At/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, the/DT options/NNS were/VBD :/: Crunch/VB money/NN to/TO stop/VB the/DT boost/NN in/IN the/DT aggregates/NNS ,/, as/IN Sir/NNP Alan/NNP surely/RB advised/VBD ,/, and/CC forget/VB the/DT soaring/VBG pound/NN ./.
To/TO push/VB the/DT pound/NN even/RB lower/RBR trying/VBG to/TO cure/VB the/DT trade/NN deficit/NN ,/, a/DT policy/NN Britain/NNP has/VBZ repeatedly/RB proved/VBN disastrous/JJ ./.
Or/CC to/TO supply/VB enough/JJ money/NN to/TO meet/VB the/DT increased/VBN demand/NN and/CC stabilize/VB the/DT exchange/NN rate/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT Chancellor/NNP argued/VBD ,/, and/CC ensure/VB the/DT permanence/NN of/IN this/DT policy/NN by/IN joining/VBG the/DT EMS/NNP ./.
Faced/VBN with/IN a/DT similar/JJ situation/NN ,/, Paul/NNP Volcker/NNP let/VBD the/DT dollar/NN soar/VB ,/, -LRB-/-LRB- though/IN monetary/JJ aggregates/NNS also/RB grew/VBD so/RB rapidly/RB monetarists/NNS issued/VBD egg-on-the-face/JJ warnings/NNS of/IN inflation/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
But/CC this/DT devastated/VBD the/DT U.S./NNP manufacturing/NN sector/NN ,/, laying/VBG the/DT seeds/NNS of/IN protectionism/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP ,/, though/IN not/RB allowed/VBN to/TO join/VB the/DT EMS/NNP ,/, chose/VBD to/TO ``/`` shadow/VB ''/'' the/DT deutsche/NN mark/NN ./.
He/PRP reaped/VBD inflation/NN along/IN with/IN rapid/JJ growth/NN ,/, no/DT doubt/NN validating/VBG Sir/NNP Alan/NNP 's/POS predictions/NNS in/IN the/DT Prime/NNP Minister/NNP 's/POS mind/NN ./.
But/CC more/RBR recently/RB ,/, the/DT pound/NN has/VBZ been/VBN falling/VBG with/IN high/JJ inflation/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ also/RB seemed/VBN almost/RB impervious/JJ to/TO the/DT high/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP deployed/VBD to/TO stop/VB it/PRP ./.
So/IN the/DT British/JJ experience/NN presents/VBZ a/DT genuine/JJ puzzle/NN that/WDT reaches/VBZ far/RB beyond/IN the/DT shores/NNS of/IN Albion/NNP ./.
We/PRP had/VBD been/VBN soliciting/VBG opinions/NNS on/IN it/PRP long/JJ before/IN Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP 's/POS resignation/NN ,/, and/CC offer/VBP some/DT of/IN the/DT collection/NN for/IN the/DT benefit/NN of/IN his/PRP$ successor/NN and/CC one-time/JJ deputy/NN ,/, John/NNP Major/NNP ./.
To/TO begin/VB with/IN ,/, we/PRP should/MD note/VB that/IN in/IN contrast/NN to/TO the/DT U.S./NNP deficit/NN ,/, Britain/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN running/VBG largish/JJ budget/NN surpluses/NNS ./.
In/IN pursuit/NN of/IN this/DT mystery/NN ,/, Keynesian/JJ adepts/NNS and/CC twin-deficit/NN mavens/NNS need/MD not/RB apply/VB ./.
We/PRP should/MD also/RB add/VB Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP 's/POS own/JJ explanation/NN ,/, as/IN we/PRP understand/VBP it/PRP ./.
Unlike/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ,/, Britain/NNP never/RB achieved/VBD even/RB a/DT momentary/JJ reduction/NN in/IN real/JJ wages/NNS ./.
The/DT wage/NN stickiness/NN ,/, which/WDT OECD/NNP studies/NNS confirm/VBP is/VBZ particularly/RB high/JJ in/IN Britain/NNP ,/, gives/VBZ its/PRP$ economy/NN a/DT structural/JJ bias/NN toward/IN inflation/NN ./.
Inflation/NN is/VBZ easier/JJR to/TO spark/VB and/CC harder/JJR to/TO control/VB ./.
We/PRP should/MD also/RB concede/VB that/IN in/IN the/DT British/JJ experience/NN the/DT monetarist/NN cause/NN regains/VBZ some/DT of/IN the/DT credibility/NN it/PRP lost/VBD in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP experience/NN ./.
Nearby/JJ Paul/NNP Craig/NNP Roberts/NNP ,/, a/DT distinguished/VBN supply-sider/NN with/IN monetarist/NN sympathies/NNS ,/, argues/VBZ the/DT case/NN for/IN Sir/NNP Alan/NNP ./.
Perhaps/RB the/DT fiscal/JJ shock/NN of/IN tax/NN cuts/NNS is/VBZ after/IN all/DT best/JJS absorbed/VBN by/IN floating/VBG rates/NNS ,/, though/IN of/IN course/NN in/IN the/DT event/NN Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP resigned/VBD over/IN whether/IN to/TO support/VB a/DT weak/JJ pound/NN ,/, not/RB restrain/VB a/DT strong/JJ one/CD ./.
We/PRP recall/VBP that/IN Mr./NNP Roberts/NNP not/RB only/RB chides/VBZ the/DT Chancellor/NNP for/IN being/VBG too/RB easy/RB because/IN of/IN a/DT desire/NN to/TO constrain/VB sterling/JJ ,/, but/CC also/RB led/VBD the/DT chorus/NN saying/VBG that/IN Mr./NNP Volcker/NNP was/VBD too/RB tight/JJ when/WRB he/PRP let/VBD the/DT dollar/NN rise/NN ./.
Somewhere/RB in/IN between/IN there/EX must/MD be/VB a/DT golden/JJ mean/NN ,/, perhaps/RB measured/VBN by/IN M-Whatever/NNP ,/, but/CC perhaps/RB measured/VBN by/IN purchasing/VBG power/NN parity/NN ./.
The/DT globalists/NNS tend/VBP to/TO think/VB Mr./NNP Lawson/NNP ran/VBD onto/IN technical/JJ reefs/NNS ./.
In/IN fixing/VBG rates/NNS the/DT choice/NN of/IN initial/JJ parities/NNS is/VBZ crucial/JJ ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, and/CC perhaps/RB he/PRP picked/VBD the/DT wrong/JJ pound-DM/JJ rate/NN ./.
For/IN that/DT matter/NN ,/, perhaps/RB he/PRP fixed/VBD to/TO the/DT wrong/JJ currency/NN ./.
We/PRP sympathize/VBP with/IN Mrs./NNP Thatcher/NNP 's/POS reluctance/NN to/TO tie/VB her/PRP$ currency/NN to/TO one/CD governed/VBN by/IN the/DT domestic/JJ political/JJ imperatives/NNS of/IN West/NNP Germany/NNP ./.

Alan/NNP Reynolds/NNP of/IN Polyconomics/NNP adds/VBZ his/PRP$ suspicion/NN that/IN the/DT unrecognized/JJ inflationary/JJ culprit/NN is/VBZ the/DT budget/NN surplus/NN ./.
Those/DT who/WP can/MD shake/VB Keynesian/JJ ghosts/NNS out/IN of/IN their/PRP$ heads/NNS might/MD recognize/VB that/IN the/DT retirement/NN of/IN gilts/NNS for/IN cash/NN is/VBZ equivalent/JJ to/TO an/DT expansionary/JJ open-market/NN operation/NN ,/, indeed/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT definition/NN of/IN an/DT open/JJ market/NN operation/NN to/TO expand/VB the/DT money/NN supply/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Reynolds/NNP also/RB notes/VBZ that/IN since/IN British/JJ banks/NNS have/VBP no/DT reserve/NN requirements/NNS ,/, high/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS are/VBP less/RBR likely/JJ to/TO curb/VB inflation/NN than/IN to/TO cause/VB recession/NN ./.
We/PRP would/MD add/VB that/IN in/IN political/JJ terms/NNS ,/, Mrs./NNP Thatcher/NNP 's/POS problem/NN was/VBD failing/VBG to/TO decide/VB between/IN the/DT Chancellor/NNP and/CC her/PRP$ adviser/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, neither/DT policy/NN was/VBD followed/VBN ,/, and/CC instead/RB of/IN learning/VBG anything/NN we/PRP are/VBP left/VBN with/IN a/DT mystery/NN ./.
