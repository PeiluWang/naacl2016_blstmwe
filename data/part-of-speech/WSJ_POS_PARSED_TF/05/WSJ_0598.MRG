Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP critics/NNS used/VBD to/TO complain/VB of/IN ``/`` stop/VB and/CC go/VB ''/'' monetary/JJ policies/NNS ./.
They/PRP claimed/VBD that/IN the/DT Fed/NNP would/MD first/RB give/VB a/DT green/JJ light/NN to/TO the/DT economy/NN by/IN making/VBG credit/NN readily/RB available/JJ and/CC then/RB turn/VB on/RP the/DT red/JJ and/CC bring/VB growth/NN to/TO a/DT screeching/JJ halt/NN ./.
But/CC under/IN Alan/NNP Greenspan/NNP that/WDT has/VBZ changed/VBN ./.
A/DT supremely/RB cautious/JJ man/NN ,/, the/DT Fed/NNP chairman/NN is/VBZ forever/RB blinking/RB yellow/JJ ./.
Indeed/RB ,/, his/PRP$ caution/NN has/VBZ become/VBN legendary/JJ within/IN the/DT government/NN ./.
He/PRP fusses/VBZ endlessly/RB over/IN economic/JJ statistics/NNS ,/, dissecting/VBG them/PRP in/IN dozens/NNS of/IN ways/NNS ,/, probing/VBG for/IN hours/NNS in/IN search/NN of/IN potential/JJ problems/NNS ./.
After/IN thoroughly/RB digesting/VBG reams/NNS of/IN information/NN ,/, he/PRP often/RB concludes/VBZ that/IN more/JJR data/NNS are/VBP needed/VBN ,/, and/CC when/WRB he/PRP finally/RB decides/VBZ to/TO act/VB ,/, his/PRP$ movements/NNS sometimes/RB seem/VBP excrutiatingly/RB small/JJ ./.
Such/JJ caution/NN was/VBD evident/JJ after/IN the/DT recent/JJ Friday-the-#th/JJ stock/NN market/NN plunge/NN ./.
Some/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN officials/NNS urged/VBD Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP to/TO make/VB an/DT immediate/JJ public/JJ announcement/NN of/IN his/PRP$ plans/NNS to/TO provide/VB ample/JJ credit/NN to/TO the/DT markets/NNS ./.
But/CC he/PRP refused/VBD ,/, claiming/VBG that/IN he/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO see/VB what/WP happened/VBD Monday/NNP morning/NN before/IN making/VBG any/DT public/JJ statement/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP 's/POS decision/NN to/TO keep/VB quiet/NN also/RB prompted/VBD a/DT near-mutiny/NN within/IN the/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS ranks/NNS ./.
A/DT ``/`` senior/JJ Fed/NNP official/NN ''/'' spoke/VBD on/IN Saturday/NNP after/IN the/DT market/NN swoon/NN to/TO both/PDT the/DT Washington/NNP Post/NNP and/CC the/DT New/NNP York/NNP Times/NNP ,/, saying/VBG the/DT Fed/NNP was/VBD prepared/VBN to/TO provide/VB as/IN much/JJ credit/NN as/IN the/DT markets/NNS needed/VBD ./.
The/DT statement/NN angered/VBD Chairman/NNP Greenspan/NNP ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD greeted/VBN with/IN applause/NN by/IN the/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN and/CC the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ./.
And/CC ,/, while/IN the/DT mutinous/JJ Fed/NNP member/NN has/VBZ n't/RB gone/VBN public/JJ ,/, some/DT Fed/NNP governors/NNS ,/, most/RBS notably/RB Vice/NNP Chairman/NNP Manuel/NNP Johnson/NNP ,/, are/VBP known/VBN to/TO have/VB disagreed/VBN with/IN the/DT chairman/NN 's/POS decision/NN to/TO remain/VB silent/JJ ./.
Ironically/RB ,/, the/DT anonymous/JJ official/NN 's/POS comments/NNS have/VBP earned/VBN some/DT plaudits/NNS for/IN Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ mistakenly/RB seen/VBN as/IN the/DT source/NN ./.
At/IN a/DT hearing/NN last/JJ week/NN ,/, Democratic/JJ Sen./NNP Chris/NNP Dodd/NNP of/IN Connecticut/NNP told/VBD Treasury/NNP Secretary/NNP Nicholas/NNP Brady/NNP that/IN ``/`` Chairman/NNP Greenspan/NNP 's/POS ''/'' announcement/NN over/IN the/DT Oct./NNP #/CD weekend/NN was/VBD a/DT ``/`` very/RB important/JJ statement/NN ./. ''/''
Mr./NNP Brady/NNP hesitantly/RB replied/VBD that/IN he/PRP was/VBD n't/RB sure/JJ whether/IN Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP ``/`` made/VBD a/DT statement/NN himself/PRP ,/, or/CC whether/IN that/DT was/VBD a/DT newspaper/NN report/NN ./. ''/''
The/DT Fed/NNP chairman/NN 's/POS caution/NN was/VBD apparent/JJ again/RB on/IN the/DT Monday/NNP morning/NN after/IN the/DT market/NN 's/POS plunge/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT central/JJ bank/NN took/VBD only/RB modest/JJ steps/NNS to/TO aid/VB the/DT markets/NNS ./.
A/DT surprisingly/RB small/JJ amount/NN of/IN reserves/NNS was/VBD added/VBN to/TO the/DT banking/NN system/NN ./.
And/CC ,/, by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN that/DT week/NN ,/, the/DT key/JJ federal/JJ funds/NNS interest/NN rate/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ largely/RB controlled/VBN by/IN the/DT Fed/NNP ,/, had/VBD settled/VBN at/IN #.#/CD %/NN ,/, barely/RB changed/VBN from/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN just/RB under/IN #/CD %/NN that/WDT prevailed/VBD the/DT previous/JJ week/NN ./.
Bush/NNP administration/NN officials/NNS appear/VBP increasingly/RB concerned/VBN that/IN Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP is/VBZ cautious/JJ to/TO a/DT fault/NN ./.
Signs/NNS of/IN growing/VBG weakness/NN in/IN the/DT economy/NN ,/, paired/VBN with/IN indications/NNS that/IN inflation/NN is/VBZ staying/VBG well/RB under/IN control/NN ,/, have/VBP caused/VBN them/PRP to/TO wonder/VB why/WRB the/DT Fed/NNP chairman/NN is/VBZ so/RB grudging/JJ in/IN reducing/VBG rates/NNS ./.
Those/DT concerns/NNS are/VBP n't/RB expressed/VBN in/IN public/NN ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT administration/NN and/CC the/DT Fed/NNP have/VBP been/VBN going/VBG out/IN of/IN their/PRP$ way/NN in/IN the/DT past/JJ two/CD weeks/NNS to/TO dispel/VB any/DT impression/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP at/IN odds/NNS ,/, fearing/VBG stories/NNS about/IN an/DT administration-Fed/JJ split/NN added/VBN to/TO the/DT stock/NN market/NN 's/POS jitters/NNS ./.
Still/RB ,/, the/DT split/NN is/VBZ there/RB ./.
The/DT administration/NN 's/POS concerns/NNS are/VBP understandable/JJ ./.
The/DT economy/NN is/VBZ showing/VBG signs/NNS of/IN weakness/NN ,/, particularly/RB among/IN manufacturers/NNS ./.
Exports/NNS ,/, which/WDT played/VBD a/DT key/JJ role/NN in/IN fueling/VBG growth/NN over/IN the/DT last/JJ two/CD years/NNS ,/, seem/VBP to/TO have/VB stalled/VBN ./.
Factory/NN payrolls/NNS and/CC production/NN fell/VBD in/IN September/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT auto/NN industry/NN and/CC housing/NN are/VBP in/IN a/DT severe/JJ crunch/NN ./.
But/CC Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP remains/VBZ reluctant/JJ to/TO loosen/VB policy/NN ,/, partly/RB because/IN he/PRP faces/VBZ a/DT phalanx/NN of/IN presidents/NNS of/IN regional/JJ Fed/NNP banks/NNS who/WP oppose/VBP credit/NN easing/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT chairman/NN has/VBZ a/DT wary/JJ eye/NN aimed/VBN a/DT year/NN or/CC two/CD down/IN the/DT road/NN ./.
Inflation/NN may/MD be/VB stable/JJ at/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, running/VBG at/IN about/IN #.#/CD %/NN ./.
But/CC if/IN the/DT Fed/NNP eases/VBZ too/RB soon/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP fears/VBZ ,/, prices/NNS may/MD begin/VB to/TO accelerate/VB again/RB next/JJ year/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, if/IN the/DT Fed/NNP holds/VBZ tight/RB ,/, it/PRP may/MD be/VB able/JJ gradually/RB to/TO reduce/VB inflation/NN ,/, moving/VBG toward/IN the/DT zero-inflation/NN goal/NN that/IN the/DT Fed/NNP chairman/NN embraced/VBD in/IN testimony/NN to/TO Congress/NNP last/JJ week/NN ./.
So/IN far/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP 's/POS cautious/JJ approach/NN to/TO policy/NN has/VBZ served/VBN both/DT him/PRP and/CC the/DT nation/NN well/RB ./.
His/PRP$ hand/NN on/IN the/DT monetary/JJ tiller/NN seems/VBZ one/CD reason/NN why/WRB the/DT economy/NN next/JJ month/NN seems/VBZ highly/RB likely/JJ to/TO begin/VB an/DT unprecedented/JJ eighth/JJ year/NN of/IN peacetime/NN growth/NN without/IN a/DT recession/NN ./.
``/`` We/PRP 've/VBP gotten/VBN through/IN two/CD stock/NN market/NN crashes/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP 've/VBP gone/VBN through/IN an/DT election/NN without/IN any/DT major/JJ problems/NNS ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ David/NNP Hale/NNP ,/, an/DT economist/NN of/IN Kemper/NNP Financial/NNP Services/NNPS ./.
``/`` I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP have/VBP to/TO give/VB Greenspan/NNP a/DT good/JJ rating/NN ./. ''/''
But/CC such/JJ caution/NN is/VBZ no/DT guarantee/NN against/IN mistakes/NNS ./.
The/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS reluctance/NN to/TO ease/VB credit/NN now/RB could/MD be/VB laying/VBG the/DT groundwork/NN for/IN a/DT new/JJ recession/NN ,/, perhaps/RB starting/VBG early/JJ next/JJ year/NN ./.
If/IN that/DT happens/VBZ ,/, Chairman/NNP Greenspan/NNP could/MD well/RB become/VB an/DT open/JJ target/NN ./.
Already/RB ,/, Congress/NNP is/VBZ toying/VBG with/IN legislation/NN to/TO curb/VB the/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS independence/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT economy/NN turns/VBZ down/RB ,/, such/JJ proposals/NNS could/MD gain/VB strong/JJ momentum/NN ./.
