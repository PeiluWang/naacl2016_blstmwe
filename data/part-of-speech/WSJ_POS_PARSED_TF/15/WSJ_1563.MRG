Beta/NN is/VBZ a/DT handy/JJ gauge/NN that/WDT measures/VBZ the/DT volatility/NN of/IN a/DT stock/NN or/CC stock/NN mutual/JJ fund/NN ./.
For/IN any/DT given/VBN move/NN in/IN the/DT overall/JJ market/NN ,/, it/PRP suggests/VBZ how/WRB steeply/RB that/IN particular/JJ issue/NN might/MD rise/VB or/CC fall/VB ./.

Cautious/JJ investors/NNS should/MD generally/RB go/VB with/IN stocks/NNS that/WDT have/VB low/JJ betas/NNS ./.

``/`` Beta/NN is/VBZ only/RB part/NN of/IN the/DT risk/NN in/IN a/DT stock/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ William/NNP F./NNP Sharpe/NNP ,/, the/DT Stanford/NNP University/NNP emeritus/JJ professor/NN who/WP developed/VBD the/DT measure/NN ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, the/DT prices/NNS of/IN gold/NN and/CC other/JJ precious-metals/JJ stocks/NNS shoot/VB up/IN and/CC down/IN ,/, but/CC the/DT stocks/NNS tend/VB to/TO have/VB low/JJ betas/NNS because/IN their/PRP$ moves/NNS are/VBP not/RB market-inspired/JJ ./.
