The/DT plan/NN indeed/RB raises/VBZ from/IN #/CD %/NN to/TO #/CD %/NN the/DT number/NN of/IN freshmen/NNS applicants/NNS admitted/VBN strictly/RB by/IN academic/JJ criteria/NNS ./.
But/CC that/DT does/VBZ n't/RB mean/VB ``/`` half/NN of/IN the/DT students/NNS attending/VBG Berkeley/NNP ''/'' will/MD be/VB admitted/VBN this/DT way/NN ./.
The/DT plan/NN is/VBZ talking/VBG about/IN applicants/NNS admitted/VBN ,/, not/RB students/NNS who/WP enroll/VBP ./.
Since/IN the/DT ``/`` yield/NN ''/'' from/IN this/DT top/JJ slice/NN of/IN applicants/NNS is/VBZ relatively/RB low/JJ ,/, boosting/VBG admits/NNS from/IN #/CD %/NN to/TO #/CD %/NN will/MD boost/VB registrants/NNS from/IN about/RB #/CD %/NN to/TO #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT class/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, perhaps/RB #/CD %/NN of/IN registrants/NNS will/MD come/VB from/IN a/DT new/JJ category/NN consisting/VBG of/IN applicants/NNS whose/WP$ academic/JJ credentials/NNS ``/`` narrowly/RB missed/VBD ''/'' gaining/VBG them/PRP admission/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ category/NN ./.
But/CC against/IN that/DT combined/VBN increase/NN of/IN #/CD %/NN in/IN students/NNS chosen/VBN by/IN academic/JJ criteria/NNS ,/, the/DT plan/NN eliminates/VBZ a/DT large/JJ category/NN in/IN which/WDT admissions/NNS now/RB are/VBP based/VBN on/IN grades/NNS ,/, test/NN scores/NNS and/CC ``/`` supplemental/JJ points/NNS ''/'' for/IN factors/NNS such/JJ as/IN high-school/NN curriculum/NN ,/, English-language/JJ proficiency/NN and/CC an/DT essay/NN ./.
This/DT category/NN now/RB accounts/VBZ for/IN about/RB #/CD %/NN of/IN admits/NNS and/CC #/CD %/NN of/IN registrants/NNS ./.
The/DT plan/NN thus/RB will/MD decrease/VB by/IN #/CD %/NN ,/, for/IN a/DT net/JJ loss/NN of/IN #/CD %/NN ,/, the/DT number/NN of/IN students/NNS admitted/VBN primarily/RB by/IN academic/JJ criteria/NNS ./.
Who/WP will/MD take/VB over/RP these/DT places/NNS ?/.
The/DT plan/NN creates/VBZ a/DT new/JJ category/NN of/IN students/NNS from/IN ``/`` socioeconomically/RB disadvantaged/JJ backgrounds/NNS ,/, ''/'' a/DT concept/NN not/RB yet/RB defined/VBN ,/, and/CC gives/VBZ them/PRP about/RB #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT class/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT plan/NN 's/POS authors/NNS has/VBZ defended/VBN the/DT ``/`` socioeconomic/JJ disadvantage/NN ''/'' category/NN as/IN perhaps/RB making/VBG more/JJR sense/NN than/IN the/DT current/JJ affirmative-action/NN preferences/NNS based/VBN on/IN race/NN ./.
Perhaps/RB it/PRP does/VBZ ./.
But/CC the/DT new/JJ category/NN does/VBZ not/RB replace/VB or/CC reduce/VB Berkeley/NNP 's/POS broad/JJ racial/JJ preferences/NNS ./.
Nor/CC will/MD students/NNS from/IN racial-minority/JJ groups/NNS who/WP are/VBP admitted/VBN through/IN the/DT new/JJ category/NN be/VB counted/VBN against/IN the/DT affirmative-action/NN ``/`` target/NN ''/'' for/IN their/PRP$ group/NN ./.
