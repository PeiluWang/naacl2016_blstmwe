READY/NNP TO/TO REVIEW/NNP the/DT riskiness/NN of/IN your/PRP$ investment/NN portfolio/NN ?/.
First/RB ,/, a/DT pop/NN quiz/NN ./.
When/WRB you/PRP think/VB of/IN the/DT words/NNS ``/`` risk/NN ''/'' and/CC ``/`` investment/NN ,/, ''/'' what/WP 's/VBZ the/DT specific/NN peril/NN that/WDT comes/VBZ to/TO mind/VB ?/.
Pencils/NNS down/IN ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP like/IN most/JJS people/NNS ,/, you/PRP said/VBD it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT holding/NN that/WDT goes/VBZ completely/RB sour/JJ --/: maybe/RB a/DT bond/NN that/IN defaults/NNS or/CC a/DT stock/NN whose/WP$ value/NN disappears/VBZ in/IN a/DT bankruptcy/NN proceeding/NN ./.
``/`` People/NNS tend/VB to/TO see/VB risk/NN primarily/RB on/IN that/DT one/CD dimension/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Timothy/NNP Kochis/NNP ,/, national/JJ director/NN of/IN personal/NN financial/JJ planning/NN for/IN accountants/NNS Deloitte/NNP ,/, Haskins/NNP &/CC Sells/NNP ./.
But/CC therein/RB lies/VBZ another/DT aspect/NN of/IN investment/NN risk/NN :/: the/DT hazard/NN of/IN shaping/VBG your/PRP$ portfolio/NN to/TO avoid/VB one/CD or/CC more/JJR types/NNS of/IN risk/NN and/CC being/VBG blind-sided/JJ by/IN others/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ clearly/RB not/RB good/JJ news/NN to/TO all/DT you/PRP people/NNS who/WP sleep/VB like/IN babies/NNS every/DT night/NN ,/, lulled/VBN by/IN visions/NNS of/IN your/PRP$ money/NN sitting/VBG risk-free/JJ in/IN six-month/JJ CDs/NNS ./.
Risk/NN wears/VBZ many/JJ disguises/NNS ,/, and/CC investments/NNS that/WDT are/VBP low/JJ in/IN one/CD type/NN of/IN obvious/JJ risk/NN can/MD be/VB distressingly/RB high/JJ in/IN other/JJ ,/, less/RBR obvious/JJ kinds/NNS ./.
U.S./NNP Treasury/NNP bonds/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, are/VBP supersafe/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO returning/VBG money/NN at/IN maturity/NN ./.
But/CC their/PRP$ value/NN as/IN investments/NNS can/MD be/VB decimated/VBN by/IN inflation/NN ,/, which/WDT erodes/VBZ the/DT purchasing/VBG power/NN of/IN bonds/NNS '/POS fixed-dollar/JJ interest/NN payments/NNS ./.
Risk/NN is/VBZ also/RB a/DT function/NN of/IN time/NN ./.
When/WRB financial/JJ professionals/NNS measure/VB risk/NN mathematically/RB ,/, they/PRP usually/RB focus/VB on/IN the/DT volatility/NN of/IN short-term/JJ returns/NNS ./.
Stocks/NNS are/VBP much/RB riskier/JJR than/IN Treasury/NNP bills/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT range/NN in/IN performance/NN from/IN the/DT best/JJS years/NNS to/TO the/DT worst/JJS is/VBZ much/RB wider/JJR ./.
That/DT is/VBZ usually/RB measured/VBN by/IN the/DT standard/JJ deviation/NN ,/, or/CC divergence/NN ,/, of/IN annual/JJ results/NNS from/IN the/DT average/JJ return/NN over/IN time/NN ./.
But/CC investors/NNS who/WP are/VBP preoccupied/VBN with/IN short-term/JJ fluctuations/NNS may/MD be/VB paying/VBG too/RB little/JJ attention/NN to/TO another/DT big/JJ risk/NN --/: not/RB generating/VBG enough/JJ money/NN to/TO meet/VB long-term/JJ financial/JJ and/CC life-style/JJ goals/NNS ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, some/DT investors/NNS have/VB sworn/VBN off/RP stocks/NNS since/IN the/DT #/CD market/NN crash/NN ;/: last/JJ Friday/NNP 's/POS debacle/NN only/RB reinforced/VBD those/DT feelings/NNS ./.
But/CC the/DT stock/NN market/NN ,/, despite/IN some/DT stomach-churning/JJ declines/NNS ,/, has/VBZ far/RB outperformed/VBN other/JJ securities/NNS over/IN extended/VBN periods/NNS ./.
By/IN retreating/VBG to/TO the/DT apparent/JJ security/NN of/IN ,/, say/VB ,/, money-market/JJ funds/NNS ,/, investors/NNS may/MD not/RB be/VB earning/VBG enough/JJ investment/NN return/VB to/TO pay/VB for/IN a/DT comfortable/JJ retirement/NN ./.
``/`` That/DT 's/VBZ the/DT biggest/JJS risk/NN of/IN all/DT --/: the/DT risk/NN of/IN not/RB meeting/VBG your/PRP$ objectives/NNS ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Steven/NNP B./NNP Enright/NNP ,/, a/DT New/NNP York/NNP financial/JJ planner/NN with/IN Seidman/NNP Financial/NNP Services/NNP ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, financial/JJ advisers/NNS say/VB they/PRP take/VB several/JJ steps/NNS when/WRB evaluating/VBG the/DT riskiness/NN of/IN clients/NNS '/POS portfolios/NNS ./.
They/PRP estimate/VB the/DT return/NN a/DT person/NN 's/POS current/JJ portfolio/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO generate/VB over/IN time/NN ,/, along/IN with/IN a/DT standard/JJ deviation/NN that/WDT suggests/VBZ how/WRB much/RB the/DT return/NN will/MD vary/VB year/NN by/IN year/NN ./.
They/PRP try/VB to/TO figure/VB out/RP the/DT long-term/NN results/VBZ the/DT person/NN needs/VBZ to/TO meet/VB major/JJ goals/NNS ./.
And/CC they/PRP eyeball/NN types/NNS of/IN risk/NN that/WDT are/VBP not/RB easily/RB quantified/VBN ./.
The/DT portfolios/NNS of/IN two/CD hypothetical/JJ families/NNS ,/, one/CD a/DT couple/NN at/IN retirement/NN age/NN and/CC another/DT a/DT two-income/NN couple/NN at/IN age/NN #/CD ,/, illustrate/VB several/JJ types/NNS of/IN risk/NN that/IN investors/NNS need/VB to/TO consider/VB ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, the/DT insured/VBN municipal/JJ bonds/NNS that/WDT dominate/VB the/DT older/JJR couple/NN 's/POS portfolio/NN were/VBD probably/RB selected/VBN in/IN large/JJ part/NN for/IN their/PRP$ low/JJ repayment/NN risk/NN ./.
But/CC they/PRP expose/VB the/DT holders/NNS to/TO a/DT lot/NN of/IN inflation/NN risk/NN and/CC interest-rate/JJ risk/NN ./.
The/DT younger/JJR couple/NN 's/POS stockholdings/NNS involve/VB more/JJR risk/NN than/IN a/DT diversified/VBN stock/NN portfolio/NN because/IN the/DT bulk/NN of/IN the/DT money/NN is/VBZ in/IN a/DT single/JJ issue/NN ./.
Note/VB that/IN the/DT younger/JJR couple/NN 's/POS portfolio/NN has/VBZ a/DT higher/JJR expected/VBN annual/JJ return/NN ,/, #.#/CD %/NN vs./NN #.#/CD %/NN ,/, as/IN calculated/VBN by/IN Seidman/NNP Financial/NNP Services/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT financial-planning/JJ affiliate/NN of/IN BDO/NNP Seidman/NNP ./.
That/DT largely/RB reflects/VBZ the/DT heavy/NN stockholdings/NNS ./.
But/CC one/CD price/NN paid/VBN for/IN the/DT higher/JJR expected/VBN return/NN is/VBZ greater/JJR short-term/NN volatility/NN ,/, as/IN reflected/VBN in/IN the/DT higher/JJR standard/JJ deviation/NN that/IN Seidman/NN estimates/NNS for/IN the/DT younger/JJR couple/NN 's/POS portfolio/NN ./.
-LRB-/-LRB- Here/RB 's/VBZ how/WRB to/TO interpret/VB a/DT standard/JJ deviation/NN figure/NN :/: Take/VB the/DT expected/VBN return/NN and/CC add/VB one/CD standard/JJ deviation/NN to/TO it/PRP ./.
Then/RB take/VB the/DT expected/VBN return/NN and/CC subtract/VB one/CD standard/JJ deviation/NN ./.
In/IN two/CD of/IN three/CD years/NNS ,/, the/DT actual/JJ result/NN should/MD fall/VB within/IN that/DT range/NN if/IN all/DT the/DT assumptions/NNS were/VBD accurate/JJ ./.
Then/RB add/VB and/CC subtract/VB two/CD standard/JJ deviations/NNS to/TO get/VB a/DT wider/JJR range/NN ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ a/DT #/CD %/NN probability/NN any/DT year/NN 's/POS result/NN will/MD fall/VB in/IN the/DT range/NN ./. -RRB-/-RRB-
Of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT greater/JJR volatility/NN of/IN the/DT younger/JJR couple/NN 's/POS portfolio/NN does/VBZ n't/RB necessarily/RB mean/VB those/DT investments/NNS are/VBP riskier/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN meeting/VBG the/DT holders/NNS '/POS long-term/JJ goals/NNS ./.
Indeed/RB ,/, the/DT older/JJR couple/NN 's/POS portfolio/NN could/MD actually/RB be/VB riskier/NN in/IN that/DT sense/NN if/IN the/DT expected/VBN return/NN wo/MD n't/RB generate/VB enough/JJ dollars/NNS to/TO meet/VB their/PRP$ spending/VBG plans/NNS ./.
``/`` They/PRP may/MD feel/VB emotionally/RB secure/JJ now/RB because/IN they/PRP are/VBP not/RB heavily/RB in/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ John/NNP H./NNP Cammack/NNP ,/, a/DT financial/JJ planner/NN with/IN Alexandra/NNP Armstrong/NNP Advisors/NNP Inc./NNP in/IN Washington/NNP ./.
``/`` But/CC they/PRP may/MD pay/VB a/DT price/NN #/CD or/CC #/CD years/NNS in/IN the/DT future/NN ./. ''/''
Ms./NNP Slater/NNP reports/NNS on/IN personal/NN finance/NN from/IN The/DT Wall/NNP Street/NNP Journal/NNP 's/POS New/NNP York/NNP bureau/NN ./.
When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO investing/VBG ,/, trying/VBG to/TO weigh/VB risk/NN and/CC reward/NN can/MD seem/VB like/IN throwing/VBG darts/NN blindfolded/VBD :/: Investors/NNS do/VBP n't/RB know/VB the/DT actual/JJ returns/NNS that/IN securities/NNS will/MD deliver/VB ,/, or/CC the/DT ups/NNS and/CC downs/NNS that/WDT will/MD occur/VB along/IN the/DT way/NN ./.
Looking/VBG to/TO the/DT past/NN can/MD provide/VB some/DT clues/NNS ./.
Over/IN several/JJ decades/NNS ,/, for/IN instance/NN ,/, investors/NNS who/WP put/VBD up/RP with/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN 's/POS gyrations/NNS earned/VBD returns/NNS far/RB in/IN excess/NN of/IN those/DT on/IN bonds/NNS and/CC ``/`` cash/NN ''/'' investments/NNS like/IN Treasury/NN bills/NNS ./.
But/CC while/IN history/NN can/MD suggest/VB what/WP is/VBZ reasonable/JJ to/TO expect/VB there/EX 's/VBZ no/DT guarantee/NN that/IN the/DT past/NN will/MD repeat/VB itself/PRP ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, some/DT analysts/NNS believe/VB bond/NN returns/NNS and/CC volatility/NN have/VB moved/VBN permanently/RB closer/RB to/TO those/DT of/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN ./.
And/CC returns/NNS on/IN cash/NN investments/NNS may/MD continue/VB to/TO exceed/VB inflation/NN by/IN a/DT wider/JJR margin/NN than/IN they/PRP did/VBD over/IN the/DT long-term/JJ past/NN ./.
