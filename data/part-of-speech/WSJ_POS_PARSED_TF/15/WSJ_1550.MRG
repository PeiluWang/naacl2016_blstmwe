Of/IN the/DT #,#/CD chemists/NNS registered/VBN for/IN the/DT society/NN 's/POS weeklong/NN meeting/NN ,/, fewer/RBR than/IN #/CD sat/VBD through/IN the/DT day/NN and/CC a/DT half/NN of/IN cold/JJ fusion/NN presentations/NNS at/IN week/NN 's/POS end/NN ./.

Most/JJS of/IN the/DT two/CD dozen/NN scientists/NNS taking/VBG the/DT podium/NN reported/VBD results/NNS with/IN new/JJ ,/, more/RBR sophisticated/JJ variations/NNS of/IN the/DT seemingly/RB simple/JJ electrolysis-of-water/JJ experiments/NNS described/VBN last/JJ March/NNP by/IN Messrs./NNP Fleischmann/NNP and/CC Pons/NNP ./.
The/DT experiments/NNS involve/VBP encircling/VBG a/DT thin/JJ rod/NN of/IN palladium/NN metal/NN with/IN a/DT wire/NN of/IN platinum/NN and/CC plunging/VBG the/DT two/CD electrodes/NNS into/IN ``/`` heavy/JJ ''/'' water/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT hydrogen/NN atoms/NNS are/VBP a/DT doubly/RB heavy/JJ form/NN known/VBN as/IN deuterium/NN ./.
When/WRB an/DT electric/JJ current/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN to/TO the/DT palladium/NN and/CC platinum/NN electrodes/NNS ,/, the/DT heavy/JJ water/NN did/VBD begin/VB to/TO break/VB up/RP ,/, or/CC dissociate/VB ./.
Ordinarily/RB the/DT electrolysis/NN ,/, or/CC breakup/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT water/NN would/MD consume/VB almost/RB all/DT of/IN the/DT electrical/JJ energy/NN ./.
But/CC Messrs./NNS Fleischmann/NNP and/CC Pons/NNP said/VBD their/PRP$ experiments/NNS also/RB produced/VBD large/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN heat/NN ./.
The/DT heat/NN energy/NN plus/IN the/DT energy/NN consumed/VBN by/IN the/DT breakup/NN of/IN the/DT water/NN molecules/NNS added/VBD to/TO far/RB more/JJR energy/NN coming/VBG out/IN of/IN the/DT apparatus/NN than/IN electrical/JJ energy/NN going/VBG in/IN ,/, they/PRP reported/VBD ./.
Because/IN they/PRP also/RB detected/VBD tritium/NN and/CC indications/NNS of/IN nuclear/JJ radiation/NN ,/, they/PRP asserted/VBD that/IN the/DT ``/`` excess/JJ ''/'' heat/NN energy/NN must/MD be/VB coming/VBG from/IN energy/NN released/VBN by/IN the/DT nuclear/JJ fusion/NN of/IN deuterium/NN atoms/NNS inside/IN the/DT palladium/NN rod/NN ./.
As/IN of/IN last/JJ weekend/NN ,/, a/DT dozen/NN labs/NNS also/RB have/VBP reported/VBN measuring/VBG ``/`` excess/JJ ''/'' heat/NN from/IN similar/JJ electrolytic/JJ experiments/NNS ,/, although/IN amounts/NNS of/IN such/JJ heat/NN vary/VBP widely/RB ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT seven/CD reports/NNS presented/VBN here/RB of/IN excess/JJ heat/NN production/NN was/VBD given/VBN by/IN Richard/NNP A./NNP Oriani/NNP ,/, professor/NN of/IN chemical/NN engineering/NN at/IN the/DT University/NNP of/IN Minnesota/NNP ./.
Mr./NNP Oriani/NNP said/VBD his/PRP$ skepticism/NN of/IN the/DT Utah/NNP claims/NNS was/VBD initially/RB confirmed/VBN when/WRB his/PRP$ first/JJ experiments/NNS last/JJ spring/NN failed/VBD to/TO produce/VB results/NNS ./.
But/CC he/PRP then/RB borrowed/VBD a/DT palladium/NN rod/NN from/IN chemists/NNS at/IN Texas/NNP A&M/NNP who/WP said/VBD they/PRP were/VBD getting/VBG excess/JJ heat/NN ./.
``/`` The/DT results/NNS were/VBD fascinating/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.
On/IN the/DT fourth/JJ ``/`` run/NN ''/'' with/IN the/DT borrowed/VBN rod/NN ,/, the/DT experiment/NN began/VBD producing/VBG excess/JJ heat/NN ./.
The/DT experiment/NN was/VBD stopped/VBN briefly/NN to/TO change/VB an/DT instrument/NN ./.
When/WRB it/PRP was/VBD restarted/VBN ,/, heat/NN output/NN ``/`` really/RB took/VBD off/RP ''/'' and/CC produced/VBD excess/JJ heat/NN for/IN several/JJ hours/NNS before/IN dying/VBG down/RP ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ./.
Typical/JJ of/IN other/JJ experiments/NNS ,/, Mr./NNP Oriani/NNP said/VBD his/PRP$ experiment/NN was/VBD ``/`` very/RB erratic/JJ ./. ''/''
It/PRP would/MD go/VB along/RP doing/VBG nothing/NN but/CC dissociating/VBG the/DT heavy/NN water/NN and/CC then/RB at/IN totally/RB unpredictable/JJ times/NNS ,/, it/PRP would/MD begin/VB producing/VBG excess/JJ heat/NN for/IN as/RB long/JJ as/IN #/CD or/CC #/CD hours/NNS before/RB quieting/VBG down/RP ./.
The/DT excess/JJ heat/NN was/VBD #/CD %/NN to/TO #/CD %/NN more/JJR than/IN the/DT energy/NN involved/VBN in/IN the/DT electrolysis/NN of/IN water/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Oriani/NNP said/VBD the/DT heat/NN bursts/NNS were/VBD too/RB large/JJ and/CC too/RB long/JJ to/TO be/VB explained/VBN by/IN the/DT sudden/JJ release/NN of/IN energy/NN that/WDT might/MD have/VB slowly/RB accumulated/VBN during/IN the/DT experiments/NNS '/POS quiescent/JJ times/NNS ,/, as/IN some/DT scientists/NNS have/VBP suggested/VBN ./.
``/`` There/EX is/VBZ a/DT reality/NN to/TO the/DT excess/JJ energy/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.
Other/JJ scientists/NNS said/VBD they/PRP also/RB were/VBD getting/VBG sporadic/JJ bursts/NNS of/IN excess/JJ heat/NN lasting/VBG several/JJ hours/NNS at/IN a/DT time/NN ./.
The/DT bursts/NNS often/RB occur/VBP ,/, they/PRP said/VBD ,/, after/RB they/PRP ``/`` perturbed/VBD ''/'' the/DT experiments/NNS by/IN raising/VBG or/CC lowering/VBG the/DT amount/NN of/IN electric/JJ current/JJ being/VBG applied/VBN ,/, or/CC switching/VBG the/DT current/NN off/RP and/CC on/RP ./.
One/CD chemist/NN privately/RB suggested/VBD this/DT hinted/VBD that/IN some/DT ``/`` anomalous/JJ ''/'' chemical/JJ reactions/NNS might/MD be/VB producing/VBG the/DT heat/NN ./.
One/CD reason/NN questions/NNS surround/VBP the/DT heat/NN experiments/NNS is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP involve/VBP unusually/RB meticulous/JJ measurements/NNS ./.
Typically/RB ,/, the/DT input/NN energy/NN ranges/VBZ from/IN a/DT third/JJ of/IN a/DT watt/NN to/TO one/CD watt/NN and/CC the/DT excess/JJ energy/NN is/VBZ measured/VBN in/IN tenths/NNS of/IN a/DT watt/NN ./.
One/CD exception/NN is/VBZ a/DT continuing/VBG experiment/NN at/IN Stanford/NNP University/NNP where/WRB as/RB much/JJ as/IN #/CD watts/NNS of/IN energy/NN are/VBP being/VBG put/VBD into/IN the/DT electrolytic/JJ cells/NNS ./.
A/DT cell/NN filled/VBN with/IN heavy/JJ water/NN is/VBZ producing/VBG #.#/CD to/TO #.#/CD watts/NNS more/JJR heat/NN than/IN an/DT identical/JJ electrolytic/JJ cell/NN filled/VBN with/IN ordinary/JJ water/NN next/JJ to/TO it/PRP ,/, reported/VBD Turgut/NNP M./NNP Gur/NNP ,/, an/DT associate/NN of/IN materials/NNS scientist/NN Robert/NNP A./NNP Huggins/NNP ,/, head/NN of/IN the/DT Stanford/NNP experimental/JJ team/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ hints/NNS the/DT excess/JJ heat/NN might/MD be/VB produced/VBN by/IN fusion/NN came/VBD from/IN brief/JJ remarks/NNS by/IN chemist/NN John/NNP Bockris/NNP of/IN Texas/NNP A&M/NNP University/NNP ./.
Mr./NNP Bockris/NNP previously/RB reported/VBD getting/VBG bursts/NNS of/IN excess/JJ heat/NN and/CC of/IN detecting/VBG increasing/VBG amounts/NNS of/IN tritium/NN forming/VBG in/IN the/DT heavy/JJ water/NN ./.
He/PRP said/VBD that/IN within/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ days/NNS ,/, he/PRP 's/VBZ gotten/VBN evidence/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT ``/`` weak/JJ correlation/NN ''/'' between/IN the/DT time/NN the/DT heat/NN bursts/NNS occur/VBP and/CC the/DT production/NN of/IN tritium/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ n't/RB any/DT way/NN to/TO continuously/RB measure/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN tritium/NN in/IN the/DT heavy/JJ water/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ been/VBN difficult/JJ to/TO tell/VB whether/CC the/DT tritium/NN formation/NN is/VBZ related/VBN to/TO the/DT heat/NN bursts/NNS or/CC some/DT other/JJ phenomenon/NN ./.
Increasingly/RB careful/JJ attempts/NNS to/TO measure/VB neutrons/NNS ,/, which/WDT would/MD be/VB strong/JJ evidence/NN of/IN fusion/NN reactions/NNS ,/, continue/VBP to/TO be/VB negative/JJ ./.
Messrs./NNS Fleischmann/NNP and/CC Pons/NNP initially/RB reported/VBD indirect/JJ evidence/NN of/IN neutrons/NNS being/VBG produced/VBN in/IN their/PRP$ experiment/NN but/CC later/RB conceded/VBD the/DT measurements/NNS were/VBD questionable/JJ ./.
Researchers/NNS at/IN Sandia/NNP National/NNP Laboratories/NNP in/IN Albuquerque/NNP ,/, N.M./NNP ,/, reported/VBD they/PRP went/VBD so/RB far/RB as/IN to/TO take/VB a/DT ``/`` cold/JJ fusion/NN ''/'' experiment/NN and/CC three/CD neutron/NN detectors/NNS into/IN a/DT tunnel/NN under/IN #/CD feet/NNS of/IN granite/NN to/TO shield/VB the/DT detectors/NNS from/IN cosmic/JJ rays/NNS ./.
A/DT number/NN of/IN times/NNS they/PRP detected/VBD neutrons/NNS in/IN one/CD ,/, sometimes/RB two/CD ,/, of/IN the/DT three/CD detectors/NNS ,/, but/CC only/RB once/RB during/IN #/CD hours/NNS of/IN the/DT experiment/NN did/VBD they/PRP detect/VB a/DT neutron/NN burst/NN in/IN all/DT three/CD detectors/NNS --/: and/CC they/PRP think/VBP that/DT was/VBD a/DT spurious/JJ event/NN ./.
Shimson/NNP Gottesfeld/NNP of/IN Los/NNP Alamos/NNP National/NNP Laboratory/NNP said/VBD researchers/NNS there/RB detected/VBD a/DT burst/NN of/IN neutrons/NNS from/IN an/DT early/JJ cold/JJ fusion/NN experiment/NN last/JJ April/NNP but/CC decided/VBD not/RB to/TO announce/VB it/PRP until/IN they/PRP could/MD confirm/VB it/PRP ./.
In/IN subsequent/JJ experiments/NNS ,/, one/CD of/IN two/CD neutron/NN detectors/NNS occasionally/RB indicated/VBD a/DT burst/NN of/IN neutrons/NNS but/CC neutron/NN bursts/NNS were/VBD never/RB recorded/VBN in/IN both/DT detectors/NNS at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./.
They/PRP concluded/VBD the/DT indications/NNS of/IN neutrons/NNS stemmed/VBD from/IN faults/NNS in/IN the/DT detectors/NNS rather/RB than/IN from/IN the/DT cold/JJ fusion/NN experiment/NN ./.
At/IN the/DT Lawrence/NNP Berkeley/NNP Laboratory/NNP in/IN California/NNP ,/, new/JJ experiments/NNS indicated/VBD that/IN the/DT lithium/NN added/VBN to/TO the/DT heavy/JJ water/NN so/IN it/PRP will/MD conduct/VB a/DT current/NN can/MD produce/VB previously/RB unsuspected/JJ electrical/JJ effects/NNS on/IN the/DT surface/NN of/IN the/DT palladium/NN rod/NN --/: which/WDT Messrs./NNS Fleischmann/NNP and/CC Pons/NNP might/MD have/VB misinterpreted/VBN ,/, reported/VBD Philip/NNP Ross/NNP from/IN the/DT California/NNP laboratory/NN ./.
