The/DT Mexico-United/NNP States/NNP Institute/NNP is/VBZ glad/JJ to/TO see/VB such/JJ a/DT high/JJ official/NN as/IN Mexico/NNP 's/POS undersecretary/NN of/IN finance/NN view/VB his/PRP$ country/NN 's/POS reforms/NNS ``/`` in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN a/DT larger/JJR ,/, world-wide/JJ process/NN ''/'' of/IN profound/JJ change/NN toward/IN free-market/JJ economics/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT statist/JJ countries/NNS ./.
Having/VBG said/VBD that/DT ,/, we/PRP must/MD caution/VB against/IN an/DT apparent/JJ tendency/NN to/TO overstate/VB the/DT case/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB quite/RB true/JJ ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT Mexican/JJ government/NN has/VBZ ``/`` privatized/VBN ''/'' Mexicana/NNP de/NNP Aviacion/NNP ,/, as/IN Mr./NNP Ortiz/NNP claims/VBZ ./.
In/IN the/DT same/JJ sentence/NN he/PRP contradicts/VBZ himself/PRP when/WRB he/PRP reports/VBZ that/IN the/DT government/NN still/RB retains/VBZ #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT total/JJ equity/NN of/IN the/DT airline/NN ./.
How/WRB can/MD a/DT company/NN be/VB considered/VBN ``/`` privatized/VBN ''/'' if/IN the/DT state/NN is/VBZ so/RB heavily/RB represented/VBN in/IN it/PRP ?/.
-LRB-/-LRB- True/UH ,/, the/DT Mexican/JJ government/NN has/VBZ granted/VBN ``/`` control/NN ''/'' over/IN the/DT airline/NN to/TO a/DT new/JJ private/JJ consortium/NN ,/, but/CC its/PRP$ propensity/NN to/TO take/VB back/RB what/WP it/PRP gives/VBZ is/VBZ too/RB well/RB known/VBN to/TO permit/VB one/PRP to/TO be/VB sanguine/JJ ./. -RRB-/-RRB-
Regrettably/RB ,/, too/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Ortiz/NNP resorts/VBZ to/TO the/DT familiar/JJ ``/`` numbers/NNS game/NN ''/'' when/WRB he/PRP boasts/VBZ that/IN ``/`` fewer/JJR than/IN #/CD -LCB-/-LRB- state/NN enterprises/NNS -RCB-/-RRB- currently/RB remain/VBP in/IN the/DT public/JJ sector/NN ,/, ''/'' down/RB from/IN the/DT ``/`` #,#/CD public/JJ entities/NNS that/WDT existed/VBD in/IN #/CD ./.
''/'' But/CC the/DT enterprises/NNS still/RB in/IN state/NN hands/NNS include/VBP the/DT biggest/JJS and/CC most/RBS economically/RB powerful/JJ ones/NNS in/IN Mexico/NNP ;/: indeed/RB ,/, they/PRP virtually/RB constitute/VBP the/DT economic/JJ infrastructure/NN ./.
I/PRP refer/VBP essentially/RB to/TO petroleum/NN ,/, electric/JJ power/NN ,/, banking/NN and/CC newsprint/NN ./.
Those/DT enterprises/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, are/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB privatized/VBN ./.
They/PRP are/VBP officially/RB considered/VBN ``/`` strategic/JJ ,/, ''/'' and/CC their/PRP$ privatization/NN is/VBZ prohibited/VBN by/IN the/DT Mexican/JJ Constitution/NNP ./.
In/IN language/NN that/WDT sidesteps/VBZ the/DT issue/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Ortiz/NNP writes/VBZ ,/, ``/`` The/DT divestiture/NN of/IN nonpriority/NN and/CC nonstrategic/JJ public/JJ enterprises/NNS is/VBZ an/DT essential/JJ element/NN of/IN President/NNP Carlos/NNP Salinas/NNP 's/POS plan/NN to/TO modernize/VB Mexico/NNP 's/POS economy/NN .../: ./.

Yet/RB clearly/RB ,/, modernization/NN must/MD embrace/VB its/PRP$ key/JJ industries/NNS before/RB it/PRP can/MD be/VB said/VBD to/TO have/VB caught/VBN the/DT ``/`` privatization/NN bug/NN ./. ''/''
The/DT bottom/JJ line/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ not/RB economic/JJ but/CC political/JJ reform/NN ./.
A/DT long/JJ succession/NN of/IN Mexican/JJ presidents/NNS arbitrarily/RB nationalized/VBD whatever/WDT industry/NN they/PRP took/VBD a/DT fancy/NN to/TO ,/, without/IN having/VBG to/TO answer/VB to/TO the/DT public/NN ./.
To/TO guarantee/VB that/IN Mexicana/NNP de/IN Aviacion/NNP and/CC other/JJ companies/NNS will/MD really/RB be/VB privatized/VBN ,/, Mexico/NNP needs/VBZ a/DT pluri-party/JJ political/JJ system/NN that/WDT will/MD ensure/VB democracy/NN and/CC hence/RB accountability/NN ./.
