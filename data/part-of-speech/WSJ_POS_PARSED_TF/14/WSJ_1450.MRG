Underclass/JJ neighborhoods/NNS offer/VBP relatively/RB few/JJ employment/NN opportunities/NNS ,/, contributing/VBG to/TO the/DT poverty/NN of/IN local/JJ residents/NNS ./.
Small/JJ neighborhood/NN businesses/NNS could/MD provide/VB more/JJR jobs/NNS ,/, if/IN crime/NN were/VBD not/RB so/RB harmful/JJ to/TO creating/VBG and/CC maintaining/VBG those/DT businesses/NNS ./.
This/DT may/MD help/VB explain/VB why/WRB small/JJ businesses/NNS create/VBP #/CD %/NN of/IN all/DT jobs/NNS nationally/RB ,/, but/CC only/RB #/CD %/NN of/IN jobs/NNS in/IN a/DT crime-ridden/JJ city/NN like/IN New/NNP York/NNP ./.
Bigger/JJR business/NN can/MD often/RB better/RBR afford/VB to/TO minimize/VB the/DT cost/NN of/IN crime/NN ./.
The/DT New/NNP York/NNP study/NN found/VBD that/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN security/NN measures/NNS in/IN firms/NNS with/IN fewer/JJR than/IN five/CD employees/NNS was/VBD almost/RB $/$ #,#/CD per/IN worker/NN ,/, compared/VBN with/IN one-third/RB that/DT amount/NN for/IN firms/NNS with/IN more/JJR than/IN #/CD employees/NNS ./.
The/DT shift/NN of/IN retailing/NN to/TO large/JJ shopping/NN centers/NNS has/VBZ created/VBN even/RB greater/JJR economies/NNS of/IN scale/NN for/IN providing/VBG low-crime/JJ business/NN environments/NNS ./.
Private/JJ security/NN guards/NNS and/CC moonlighting/VBG police/NNS can/MD invoke/VB the/DT law/NN of/IN trespass/NN to/TO regulate/VB access/NN to/TO these/DT quasi-public/JJ places/NNS ./.

Few/JJ small/JJ neighborhood/NN businesses/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, can/MD afford/VB such/JJ protection/NN ,/, even/RB in/IN collaboration/NN with/IN other/JJ local/JJ merchants/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT neighborhoods/NNS with/IN the/DT highest/JJS crime/NN rates/NNS ,/, small/JJ business/NN generally/RB relies/VBZ on/IN the/DT public/JJ police/NN force/NN for/IN protection/NN ./.
This/DT creates/VBZ several/JJ problems/NNS ./.
One/CD is/VBZ that/IN there/EX are/VBP not/RB enough/JJ police/NN to/TO satisfy/VB small/JJ businesses/NNS ./.
The/DT number/NN one/CD proposal/NN for/IN reducing/VBG crime/NN in/IN the/DT New/NNP York/NNP survey/NN was/VBD to/TO put/VB more/JJR police/NNS on/IN foot/NN or/CC scooter/NN patrol/NN ,/, suggested/VBN by/IN more/JJR than/IN two-thirds/NNS of/IN the/DT respondents/NNS ./.
Only/RB #/CD %/NN supported/VBD private/JJ security/NN patrols/NNS funded/VBN by/IN the/DT merchants/NNS themselves/PRP ./.
A/DT second/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ the/DT persistent/JJ frustration/NN of/IN false/JJ alarms/NNS ,/, which/WDT can/MD make/VB urban/JJ police/NNS less/RBR than/IN enthusiastic/JJ about/IN responding/VBG to/TO calls/NNS from/IN small/JJ businesses/NNS ./.
Only/RB half/PDT the/DT New/NNP York/NNP small/JJ businesses/NNS surveyed/VBN ,/, for/IN their/PRP$ part/NN ,/, are/VBP satisfied/JJ with/IN the/DT police/NN response/NN they/PRP receive/VBP ./.
Some/DT cities/NNS ,/, including/VBG New/NNP York/NNP ,/, have/VBP experimented/VBN with/IN special/JJ tax/NN districts/NNS for/IN commercial/JJ areas/NNS that/WDT provide/VBP additional/JJ patrols/NNS funded/VBN by/IN local/JJ businesses/NNS ./.
But/CC this/DT raises/VBZ added/VBN cost/NN barriers/NNS to/TO urban/JJ entrepreneurship/NN ./.
Another/DT solution/NN cities/NNS might/MD consider/VB is/VBZ giving/VBG special/JJ priority/NN to/TO police/NN patrols/NNS of/IN small-business/NN areas/NNS ./.
For/IN cities/NNS losing/VBG business/NN to/TO suburban/JJ shopping/NN centers/NNS ,/, it/PRP may/MD be/VB a/DT wise/JJ business/NN investment/NN to/TO help/VB keep/VB those/DT jobs/NNS and/CC sales/NNS taxes/NNS within/IN city/NN limits/NNS ./.
Increased/VBN patrolling/NN of/IN business/NN zones/NNS makes/VBZ sense/NN because/IN urban/JJ crime/NN is/VBZ heavily/RB concentrated/JJ in/IN such/JJ ``/`` hot/JJ spots/NNS ''/'' of/IN pedestrian/NN density/NN ./.
With/IN National/NNP Institute/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP support/NN ,/, the/DT Minneapolis/NNP police/NN and/CC the/DT Crime/NNP Control/NNP Institute/NNP are/VBP currently/RB testing/VBG the/DT effects/NNS of/IN such/PDT a/DT strategy/NN ,/, comparing/VBG its/PRP$ deterrence/NN value/NN with/IN traditional/JJ random/JJ patrols/NNS ./.
Small-business/NN patrols/NNS would/MD be/VB an/DT especially/RB helpful/JJ gesture/NN whenever/WRB a/DT small-business/NN person/NN is/VBZ scheduled/VBN to/TO testify/VB against/IN a/DT robbery/NN suspect/NN ./.
While/IN no/DT guarantee/NN ,/, an/DT increased/VBN police/NN presence/NN might/MD even/RB deter/VB further/JJ attacks/NNS ./.
It/PRP might/MD even/RB have/VB saved/VBN the/DT life/NN ,/, and/CC business/NN ,/, of/IN Israel/NNP Ortiz/NNP ./.
