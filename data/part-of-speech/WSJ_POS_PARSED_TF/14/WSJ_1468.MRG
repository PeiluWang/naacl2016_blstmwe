August/NNP through/IN October/NNP traditionally/RB is/VBZ the/DT busiest/JJS season/NN for/IN the/DT bakeware/NN business/NN ,/, as/IN many/JJ retailers/NNS use/VBP the/DT goods/NNS as/IN autumn/NN promotional/JJ items/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Stein/NNP said/VBD some/DT retailers/NNS --/: perhaps/RB anxious/JJ about/IN minimizing/VBG inventories/NNS --/: appear/VBP to/TO have/VB held/VBN back/RB on/IN orders/NNS in/IN September/NNP but/CC have/VBP been/VBN ordering/VBG more/RBR heavily/RB in/IN October/NNP ./.
