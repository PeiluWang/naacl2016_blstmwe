OPEC/NNP 's/POS ability/NN to/TO produce/VB more/JJR petroleum/NN than/IN it/PRP can/MD sell/VB is/VBZ beginning/VBG to/TO cast/VB a/DT shadow/NN over/IN world/NN oil/NN markets/NNS ./.

OPEC/NNP is/VBZ currently/RB producing/VBG more/JJR than/IN #/CD million/CD barrels/NNS a/DT day/NN ,/, sharply/RB above/IN its/PRP$ nominal/JJ ,/, self-imposed/JJ fourth-quarter/JJ ceiling/NN of/IN #.#/CD million/CD ,/, according/VBG to/TO OPEC/NNP and/CC industry/NN officials/NNS at/IN an/DT oil/NN conference/NN here/RB sponsored/VBN by/IN the/DT Oil/NNP Daily/NNP and/CC the/DT International/NNP Herald/NNP Tribune/NNP ./.
