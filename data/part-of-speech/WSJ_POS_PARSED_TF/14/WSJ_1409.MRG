Bureaucrats/NNS may/MD deserve/VB their/PRP$ bad/JJ reputation/NN ,/, after/IN all/DT ./.
Matthew/NNP Lesko/NNP ,/, something/NN of/IN a/DT professional/JJ defender/NN of/IN government/NN ,/, thought/VBD he/PRP had/VBD a/DT sure-fire/JJ winner/NN last/JJ summer/NN when/WRB he/PRP offered/VBD $/$ #,#/CD for/IN the/DT best/JJS ``/`` verifiable/JJ story/NN of/IN #/CD words/NNS or/CC less/JJR about/IN how/WRB a/DT government/NN bureaucrat/NN helped/VBD you/PRP ./. ''/''
He/PRP sent/VBD out/RP thousands/NNS of/IN news/NN releases/NNS from/IN his/PRP$ Kensington/NNP ,/, Md./NNP ,/, office/NN ./.
He/PRP plugged/VBD the/DT contest/NN on/IN Larry/NNP King/NNP 's/POS radio/NN show/NN ,/, on/IN Pat/NNP Sajak/NNP 's/POS television/NN show/NN and/CC on/IN the/DT C-SPAN/NNP cable/NN television/NN network/NN ./.
He/PRP talked/VBD about/IN it/PRP in/IN every/DT speech/NN he/PRP made/VBD as/IN he/PRP roamed/VBD the/DT country/NN promoting/VBG his/PRP$ books/NNS ,/, which/WDT dispense/VBP handy/JJ how-to/JJ advice/NN on/IN using/VBG government/NN information/NN for/IN fun/NN and/CC profit/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Lesko/NNP figured/VBD he/PRP would/MD be/VB flooded/VBN with/IN entries/NNS by/IN now/RB ./.
After/IN all/DT ,/, he/PRP says/VBZ ,/, ``/`` we/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN like/IN #/CD million/CD bureaucrats/NNS ./. ''/''
And/CC in/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT $/$ #,#/CD ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ promised/VBN the/DT winner/NN a/DT ``/`` My/PRP$ Favorite/JJ Bureaucrat/NN ''/'' plaque/NN and/CC offered/VBD each/DT of/IN two/CD runners-up/NNS $/$ #/CD ./.
So/RB far/RB ,/, though/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Lesko/NNP has/VBZ received/VBN only/RB one/CD entry/NN ./.
To/TO make/VB matters/NNS worse/RBR ,/, the/DT lone/JJ nomination/NN came/VBD from/IN another/DT bureaucrat/NN :/: A/DT woman/NN from/IN the/DT New/NNP York/NNP State/NNP Department/NNP of/IN Taxation/NNP and/CC Finance/NNP who/WP nominated/VBD her/PRP$ boss/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Lesko/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ making/VBG the/DT rules/NNS as/IN he/PRP goes/VBZ ,/, has/VBZ determined/VBN that/IN bureaucrats/NNS are/VBP eligible/JJ for/IN nomination/NN by/IN other/JJ bureaucrats/NNS ./.
But/CC he/PRP says/VBZ he/PRP would/MD prefer/VB to/TO get/VB nominations/NNS from/IN rank-and-file/JJ folks/NNS ./.
He/PRP admits/VBZ that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ n't/RB had/VBN much/JJ luck/NN generating/VBG free/JJ publicity/NN for/IN his/PRP$ contest/NN ./.
Newspapers/NNS ,/, including/VBG this/DT one/CD ,/, have/VBP generally/RB ignored/VBN his/PRP$ news/NN releases/NNS ./.
Talk/NN show/NN hosts/NNS quickly/RB change/VBP the/DT topic/NN ./.
But/CC Mr./NNP Lesko/NNP 's/POS staff/NN is/VBZ beginning/VBG to/TO wonder/VB whether/IN there/EX is/VBZ n't/RB some/DT larger/JJR phenomenon/NN foiling/VBG the/DT contest/NN ./.
``/`` Is/VBZ the/DT government/NN not/RB helping/VBG anybody/NN ?/. ''/'' asks/VBZ Toni/NNP Murray/NNP ,/, an/DT assistant/NN to/TO Mr./NNP Lesko/NNP ./.
Mr./NNP Lesko/NNP himself/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB yet/RB prepared/JJ to/TO accept/VB that/DT explanation/NN ./.
``/`` People/NNS hate/VBP to/TO write/VB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP says/VBZ ./.
``/`` Maybe/RB people/NNS do/VBP n't/RB believe/VB I/PRP want/VBP to/TO give/VB this/DT money/NN away/RB ./. ''/''
Maybe/RB Americans/NNPS are/VBP just/RB so/RB annoyed/JJ with/IN government/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP n't/RB interested/JJ in/IN admitting/VBG that/IN bureaucrats/NNS come/VBP in/RP handy/JJ once/RB in/IN a/DT while/NN ./.
If/IN he/PRP sponsored/VBD a/DT contest/NN on/IN how/WRB a/DT bureaucrat/NN mishandled/VBD something/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Lesko/NNP admits/VBZ ,/, ``/`` I/PRP 'd/MD get/VB #,#/CD entries/NNS ./. ''/''
Now/RB there/EX 's/VBZ an/DT idea/NN ./.
