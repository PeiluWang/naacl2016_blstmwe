A/DT bill/NN that/WDT would/MD permit/VB the/DT Securities/NNPS and/CC Exchange/NNP Commission/NNP to/TO monitor/VB the/DT financial/JJ condition/NN of/IN securities/NNS firms/NNS '/POS holding/VBG companies/NNS is/VBZ facing/VBG tough/JJ opposition/NN from/IN some/DT Wall/NNP Street/NNP firms/NNS ,/, which/WDT argue/VBP that/IN the/DT legislation/NN is/VBZ unnecessary/JJ ./.
The/DT legislation/NN and/CC other/JJ issues/NNS related/VBN to/TO the/DT stock/NN market/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT focus/NN of/IN hearings/NNS this/DT week/NN by/IN the/DT House/NNP Telecommunications/NNPS and/CC Finance/NNP Subcommittee/NNP and/CC the/DT Senate/NNP Securities/NNPS Subcommittee/NNP ./.
Richard/NNP Breeden/NNP ,/, the/DT new/JJ chairman/NN of/IN the/DT SEC/NNP ,/, has/VBZ n't/RB taken/VBN a/DT formal/JJ position/NN on/IN the/DT bill/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD also/RB require/VB investors/NNS to/TO disclose/VB large/JJ trades/NNS and/CC give/VB the/DT SEC/NNP additional/JJ authority/NN during/IN market/NN emergencies/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, he/PRP recently/RB told/VBD the/DT Senate/NNP Banking/NNP Committee/NNP that/IN he/PRP believes/VBZ the/DT agency/NN should/MD have/VB explicit/JJ authority/NN to/TO monitor/VB debt/NN levels/NNS at/IN holding/VBG companies/NNS and/CC affiliates/NNS of/IN broker-dealers/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP frequently/RB used/VBN to/TO issue/VB bridge/JJ loans/NNS ./.
The/DT bridge/JJ loans/NNS are/VBP intended/JJ to/TO provide/VB temporary/JJ financing/NN for/IN acquisitions/NNS ./.
Since/IN such/JJ loans/NNS are/VBP often/RB refinanced/VBN through/IN the/DT sale/NN of/IN high-risk/JJ ,/, high-yield/JJ junk/NN bonds/NNS ,/, the/DT recent/JJ woes/NNS of/IN the/DT junk-bond/NN market/NN have/VBP renewed/VBN concerns/NNS among/IN regulators/NNS about/IN the/DT risks/NNS associated/VBN with/IN Wall/NNP Street/NNP firms/NNS issuing/VBG bridge/JJ loans/NNS ./.
But/CC some/DT Wall/NNP Street/NNP executives/NNS argue/VBP that/IN such/JJ fears/NNS are/VBP unwarranted/JJ ./.
In/IN a/DT July/NNP #/CD letter/NN to/TO the/DT Senate/NNP Securities/NNPS Subcommittee/NNP ,/, First/NNP Boston/NNP Corp./NNP argued/VBD that/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN no/DT retail/JJ brokerage/NN firm/NN failed/VBN during/IN the/DT #/CD market/NN crash/NN demonstrates/VBZ that/IN current/JJ rules/NNS are/VBP adequate/JJ ./.

``/`` The/DT proposal/NN ,/, while/IN well-intended/JJ ,/, I/PRP think/VBP can/MD be/VB dangerously/RB misleading/JJ because/IN the/DT likely/JJ consequence/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO weaken/VB ,/, rather/RB than/IN strengthen/VB the/DT control/NN the/DT SEC/NNP has/VBZ exercised/VBN for/IN #/CD years/NNS over/IN the/DT financial/JJ adequacy/NN and/CC viability/NN of/IN broker-dealers/NNS ,/, ''/'' Michael/NNP Raoul-Duval/NNP ,/, managing/VBG director/NN of/IN First/NNP Boston/NNP ,/, said/VBD in/IN an/DT interview/NN ./.
The/DT bill/NN would/MD ``/`` divert/VB scarce/JJ resources/NNS of/IN the/DT commission/NN away/RB from/IN broker-dealers/NNS into/IN areas/NNS which/WDT simply/RB have/VBP no/DT way/NN of/IN affecting/VBG broker-dealers/NNS ,/, ''/'' Mr./NNP Raoul-Duval/NNP said/VBD ./.
