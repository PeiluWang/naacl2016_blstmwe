Predicting/VBG the/DT financial/JJ results/NNS of/IN computer/NN firms/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT tough/JJ job/NN lately/RB ./.

In/IN July/NNP ,/, the/DT company/NN stunned/VBD Wall/NNP Street/NNP with/IN the/DT prediction/NN that/DT growth/NN in/IN the/DT personal/JJ computer/NN business/NN overall/RB would/MD be/VB only/RB #/CD %/NN in/IN #/CD ,/, a/DT modest/JJ increase/NN when/WRB compared/VBN with/IN the/DT sizzling/JJ expansion/NN of/IN years/NNS past/JJ ./.

Microsoft/NNP 's/POS surprising/JJ strength/NN is/VBZ one/CD example/NN of/IN the/DT difficulty/NN facing/VBG investors/NNS looking/VBG for/IN reassurances/NNS about/IN the/DT financial/JJ health/NN of/IN the/DT computer/NN firms/NNS ./.
``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO know/VB what/WP to/TO expect/VB at/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Peter/NNP Rogers/NNP ,/, an/DT analyst/NN at/IN Robertson/NNP Stephens/NNP &/CC Co/NNP ./.
``/`` The/DT industry/NN defies/VBZ characterization/NN ./. ''/''

Another/DT contradictory/JJ message/NN comes/VBZ from/IN Businessland/NNP Inc./NNP ,/, a/DT computer/NN retailer/NN ./.
