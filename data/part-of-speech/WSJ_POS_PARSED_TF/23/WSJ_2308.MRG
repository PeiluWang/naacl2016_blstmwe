Peter/NNP Otradovec/NNP ,/, vice/NN president/NN for/IN planning/NN at/IN the/DT Phoenix/NNP ,/, Ariz./NNP ,/, carrier/NN ,/, said/VBD in/IN an/DT interview/NN that/IN the/DT work/NN stoppage/NN at/IN Boeing/NNP ,/, now/RB entering/VBG its/PRP$ #th/JJ day/NN ,/, ``/`` has/VBZ caused/VBN some/DT turmoil/NN in/IN our/PRP$ scheduling/NN ''/'' and/CC that/IN more/JJR than/IN #/CD passengers/NNS who/WP were/VBD booked/VBN to/TO fly/VB out/IN of/IN Houston/NNP on/IN America/NNP West/NNP would/MD now/RB be/VB put/VBN on/IN other/JJ airlines/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Otradovec/NNP said/VBD Boeing/NNP told/VBD America/NNP West/NNP that/IN the/DT #/NNP it/PRP was/VBD supposed/VBN to/TO get/VB this/DT Thursday/NNP would/MD n't/RB be/VB delivered/VBN until/IN Nov./NNP #/CD --/: the/DT day/NN after/IN the/DT airline/NN had/VBD been/VBN planning/VBG to/TO initiate/VB service/NN at/IN Houston/NNP with/IN four/CD daily/JJ flights/NNS ,/, including/VBG three/CD nonstops/NNS to/TO Phoenix/NNP and/CC one/CD nonstop/NN to/TO Las/NNP Vegas/NNP ./.
