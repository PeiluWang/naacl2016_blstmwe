With/IN economic/JJ tension/NN between/IN the/DT U.S./NNP and/CC Japan/NNP worsening/VBG ,/, many/JJ Japanese/VBP had/VBD feared/VBN last/JJ week/NN 's/POS visit/NN from/IN U.S./NNP Trade/NNP Representative/NNP Carla/NNP Hills/NNP ./.
They/PRP expected/VBD a/DT new/JJ barrage/NN of/IN demands/NNS that/IN Japan/NNP do/VB something/NN quickly/RB to/TO reduce/VB its/PRP$ trade/NN surplus/NN with/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ./.
Instead/RB ,/, they/PRP got/VBD a/DT discussion/NN of/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN the/DT U.S./NNP and/CC Japan/NNP to/TO work/VB together/RB and/CC of/IN the/DT importance/NN of/IN the/DT long-term/JJ view/NN ./.
Mrs./NNP Hills/NNP '/POS first/JJ trip/NN to/TO Japan/NNP as/IN America/NNP 's/POS chief/JJ trade/NN negotiator/NN had/VBD a/DT completely/RB different/JJ tone/NN from/IN last/JJ month/NN 's/POS visit/NN by/IN Commerce/NNP Secretary/NNP Robert/NNP A./NNP Mosbacher/NNP ./.
Mr./NNP Mosbacher/NNP called/VBD for/IN concrete/JJ results/NNS by/IN next/JJ spring/NN in/IN negotiations/NNS over/IN fundamental/JJ Japanese/JJ business/NN practices/NNS that/WDT supposedly/RB inhibit/VBP free/JJ trade/NN ./.
He/PRP said/VBD such/JJ results/NNS should/MD be/VB ``/`` measurable/JJ in/IN dollars/NNS and/CC cents/NNS ''/'' in/IN reducing/VBG the/DT U.S./NNP trade/NN deficit/NN with/IN Japan/NNP ./.
But/CC Mrs./NNP Hills/NNP ,/, speaking/VBG at/IN a/DT breakfast/NN meeting/NN of/IN the/DT American/NNP Chamber/NNP of/IN Commerce/NNP in/IN Japan/NNP on/IN Saturday/NNP ,/, stressed/VBD that/IN the/DT objective/NN ``/`` is/VBZ not/RB to/TO get/VB definitive/JJ action/NN by/IN spring/NN or/CC summer/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ rather/RB to/TO have/VB a/DT blueprint/NN for/IN action/NN ./.

She/PRP added/VBD that/IN she/PRP expected/VBD ``/`` perhaps/RB to/TO have/VB a/DT down/JJ payment/NN .../: some/DT small/JJ step/NN to/TO convince/VB the/DT American/JJ people/NNS and/CC the/DT Japanese/JJ people/NNS that/IN we/PRP 're/VBP moving/VBG in/IN earnest/NN ./. ''/''
How/WRB such/JJ remarks/NNS translate/VBP into/IN policy/NN wo/MD n't/RB become/VB clear/JJ for/IN months/NNS ./.
American/JJ and/CC Japanese/JJ officials/NNS offered/VBD several/JJ theories/NNS for/IN the/DT difference/NN in/IN approach/NN betwen/NN Mr./NNP Mosbacher/NNP and/CC Mrs./NNP Hills/NNP ./.
Many/JJ called/VBD it/PRP simply/RB a/DT contrast/NN in/IN styles/NNS ./.
But/CC some/DT saw/VBD it/PRP as/IN a/DT classic/JJ negotiating/NN tactic/NN ./.
Others/NNS said/VBD the/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN may/MD feel/VB the/DT rhetoric/NN on/IN both/DT sides/NNS is/VBZ getting/VBG out/IN of/IN hand/NN ./.
And/CC some/DT said/VBD it/PRP reflected/VBD the/DT growing/VBG debate/NN in/IN Washington/NNP over/IN pursuing/VBG free/JJ trade/NN with/IN Japan/NNP versus/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN managed/JJ trade/NN ./.
Asked/VBD to/TO compare/VB her/PRP visit/NN to/TO Mr./NNP Mosbacher/NNP 's/POS ,/, Mrs./NNP Hills/NNP replied/VBD :/: ``/`` I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB hear/VB every/DT word/NN he/PRP spoke/VBD ,/, but/CC as/IN a/DT general/JJ proposition/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP have/VBP a/DT very/RB consistent/JJ trade/NN strategy/NN in/IN the/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN ./. ''/''
Yet/RB more/JJR than/IN one/CD American/JJ official/NN who/WP sat/VBD in/RP with/IN her/PRP during/IN three/CD days/NNS of/IN talks/NNS with/IN Japanese/JJ officials/NNS said/VBD her/PRP$ tone/NN often/RB was/VBD surprisingly/RB ``/`` conciliatory/JJ ./. ''/''
``/`` I/PRP think/VBP my/PRP$ line/NN has/VBZ been/VBN very/RB consistent/JJ ,/, ''/'' Mrs./NNP Hills/NNP said/VBD at/IN a/DT news/NN conference/NN Saturday/NNP afternoon/NN ./.
``/`` I/PRP am/VBP painted/VBN sometimes/RB as/IN ferocious/JJ ,/, perhaps/RB because/IN I/PRP have/VBP a/DT ferocious/JJ list/NN of/IN statutes/NNS to/TO implement/VB ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB feel/VB very/RB ferocious/JJ ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB feel/VB either/CC hard/JJ or/CC soft/JJ ./.
I/PRP feel/VBP committed/JJ to/TO the/DT program/NN of/IN opening/VBG markets/NNS and/CC expanding/VBG trade/NN ./. ''/''
When/WRB she/PRP met/VBD the/DT local/JJ press/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN on/IN Friday/NNP ,/, Mrs./NNP Hills/NNP firmly/RB reiterated/VBD the/DT need/NN for/IN progress/NN in/IN removing/VBG barriers/NNS to/TO trade/NN in/IN forest/NN products/NNS ,/, satellites/NNS and/CC supercomputers/NNS ,/, three/CD areas/NNS targeted/VBN under/IN the/DT Super/NNP #/NNP provision/NN of/IN the/DT #/CD trade/NN bill/NN ./.
She/PRP highlighted/VBD exclusionary/JJ business/NN practices/NNS that/IN the/DT U.S./NNP government/NN has/VBZ identified/VBN ./.
But/CC her/PRP$ main/JJ thrust/NN was/VBD to/TO promote/VB the/DT importance/NN of/IN world-wide/JJ free/JJ trade/NN and/CC open/JJ competition/NN ./.
She/PRP said/VBD the/DT trade/NN imbalance/NN was/VBD mainly/RB due/JJ to/TO macroeconomic/JJ factors/NNS and/CC should/MD n't/RB be/VB tackled/VBN by/IN setting/VBG quantitative/JJ targets/NNS ./.
At/IN her/PRP$ news/NN conference/NN for/IN Japanese/JJ reporters/NNS ,/, one/CD economics/NN journalist/NN summed/VBD up/RP the/DT Japanese/JJ sense/NN of/IN relief/NN ./.
``/`` My/PRP$ impression/NN was/VBD that/IN you/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT scary/JJ old/JJ lady/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, drawing/VBG a/DT few/JJ nervous/JJ chuckles/NNS from/IN his/PRP$ colleagues/NNS ./.
``/`` But/CC I/PRP am/VBP relieved/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN you/PRP are/VBP beautiful/JJ and/CC gentle/JJ and/CC intelligent/JJ and/CC a/DT person/NN of/IN integrity/NN ./. ''/''
Mrs./NNP Hills/NNP '/POS remarks/NNS did/VBD raise/NN questions/NNS ,/, at/IN least/JJS among/IN some/DT U.S./NNP officials/NNS ,/, about/IN what/WP exactly/RB her/PRP$ stance/NN is/VBZ on/IN U.S./NNP access/NN to/TO the/DT Japanese/JJ semiconductor/NN market/NN ./.
The/DT U.S./NNP share/NN of/IN the/DT Japanese/JJ market/NN has/VBZ been/VBN stuck/JJ around/IN #/CD %/NN for/IN years/NNS ./.
Many/JJ Americans/NNPS have/VBP interpreted/VBN a/DT #/CD agreement/NN as/IN assuring/VBG U.S./NNP companies/NNS a/DT #/CD %/NN share/NN by/IN #/CD ,/, but/CC the/DT Japanese/NNPS have/VBP denied/VBN making/VBG any/DT such/JJ promise/NN ./.
At/IN one/CD of/IN her/PRP$ news/NN conferences/NNS ,/, Mrs./NNP Hills/NNP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP can/MD do/VB much/RB better/RBR than/IN #/CD %/NN ./. ''/''
