The/DT Senate/NNP 's/POS decision/NN to/TO approve/VB a/DT bare-bones/JJ deficit-reduction/NN bill/NN without/IN a/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN cut/NN still/RB leaves/VBZ open/JJ the/DT possibility/NN of/IN enacting/VBG a/DT gains/NNS tax/NN reduction/NN this/DT year/NN ./.
Late/RB Friday/NNP night/NN ,/, the/DT Senate/NNP voted/VBD #-#/CD to/TO approve/VB an/DT estimated/JJ $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD measure/NN that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN stripped/VBN of/IN hundreds/NNS of/IN provisions/NNS that/WDT would/MD have/VB widened/VBN ,/, rather/RB than/IN narrowed/VBN ,/, the/DT federal/JJ budget/NN deficit/NN ./.

``/`` We/PRP 're/VBP putting/VBG a/DT deficit-reduction/NN bill/NN back/RB in/IN the/DT category/NN of/IN being/VBG a/DT deficit-reduction/NN bill/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Senate/NNP Budget/NNP Committee/NNP Chairman/NNP James/NNP Sasser/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Tenn/NNP ./. -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
But/CC Senate/NNP supporters/NNS of/IN the/DT trimmer/JJR legislation/NN said/VBD that/IN other/JJ bills/NNS would/MD soon/RB be/VB moving/VBG through/IN Congress/NNP that/WDT could/MD carry/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT measures/NNS that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN cast/VBN aside/RB ,/, including/VBG a/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN cut/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT companion/JJ deficit-reduction/NN bill/NN already/RB passed/VBN by/IN the/DT House/NNP includes/VBZ a/DT capital-gains/NNS provision/NN ./.

``/`` No/DT one/NN can/MD predict/VB exactly/RB what/WP will/MD happen/VB on/IN the/DT House/NNP side/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Senate/NNP Minority/NNP Leader/NNP Robert/NNP Dole/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- R./NNP ,/, Kan/NNP ./. -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

The/DT Senate/NNP 's/POS decision/NN was/VBD a/DT setback/NN for/IN President/NNP Bush/NNP and/CC will/MD make/VB approval/NN of/IN a/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN cut/NN less/RBR certain/JJ this/DT year/NN ./.
Opponents/NNS of/IN the/DT cut/NN are/VBP playing/VBG hardball/NN ./.
Senate/NNP Majority/NNP Leader/NNP George/NNP Mitchell/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Maine/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD ``/`` confident/JJ ''/'' that/IN any/DT House-Senate/NNP agreement/NN on/IN the/DT deficit-reduction/NN legislation/NN would/MD n't/RB include/VB a/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN cut/NN ./.

Such/JJ legislation/NN must/MD be/VB enacted/VBN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT month/NN ./.
The/DT Senate/NNP bill/NN was/VBD pared/VBN back/RB in/IN an/DT attempt/NN to/TO speed/VB deficit-reduction/NN through/IN Congress/NNP ./.
