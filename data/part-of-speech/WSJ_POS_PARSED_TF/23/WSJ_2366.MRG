Population/NN Drain/NN Ends/VBZ For/IN Midwestern/JJ States/NNS
IOWA/NNP IS/VBZ MAKING/VBG a/DT comeback/NN ./.
So/RB are/VBP Indiana/NNP ,/, Ohio/NNP and/CC Michigan/NNP ./.
The/DT population/NN of/IN all/DT four/CD states/NNS is/VBZ on/IN the/DT upswing/NN ,/, according/VBG to/TO new/JJ Census/NNP Bureau/NNP estimates/NNS ,/, following/VBG declines/NNS throughout/IN the/DT early/JJ #s/NNS ./.
The/DT gains/NNS ,/, to/TO be/VB sure/JJ ,/, are/VBP rather/RB small/JJ ./.
Iowa/NNP ,/, for/IN instance/NN ,/, saw/VBD its/PRP$ population/NN grow/VB by/IN #,#/CD people/NNS ,/, or/CC #.#/CD %/NN ,/, between/IN #/CD and/CC #/CD ,/, the/DT Census/NNP Bureau/NNP says/VBZ ./.
Still/RB ,/, even/RB that/DT modest/JJ increase/NN is/VBZ good/JJ news/NN for/IN a/DT state/NN that/WDT had/VBD n't/RB grown/VBN at/IN all/DT since/IN #/CD ./.
Between/IN #/CD and/CC #/CD ,/, North/NNP Dakota/NNP was/VBD the/DT only/JJ state/NN in/IN the/DT Midwest/JJS to/TO lose/VB population/NN ,/, a/DT loss/NN of/IN #,#/CD people/NNS ./.
Six/CD of/IN the/DT #/CD midwestern/JJ states/NNS have/VBP been/VBN growing/VBG steadily/RB since/IN #/CD --/: Illinois/NNP ,/, Kansas/NNP ,/, Minnesota/NNP ,/, Missouri/NNP ,/, South/NNP Dakota/NNP and/CC Wisconsin/NNP ./.
The/DT Northeast/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN holding/VBG its/PRP$ own/JJ in/IN the/DT population/NN race/NN ./.
Seven/CD of/IN nine/CD states/NNS have/VBP grown/VBN each/DT year/NN since/IN #/CD ,/, including/VBG New/NNP York/NNP ,/, which/WDT lost/VBD #/CD %/NN of/IN its/PRP$ population/NN during/IN the/DT #s/NNS ./.
And/CC although/IN Pennsylvania/NNP and/CC Massachusetts/NNP suffered/VBD slight/JJ declines/NNS earlier/RBR in/IN the/DT decade/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP growing/VBG again/RB ./.
At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, several/JJ states/NNS in/IN the/DT South/NNP and/CC West/NNP have/VBP had/VBN their/PRP$ own/JJ population/NN turnaround/NN ./.
Seven/CD states/NNS that/WDT grew/VBD in/IN the/DT early/JJ #s/NNS are/VBP now/RB losing/VBG population/NN --/: West/NNP Virginia/NNP ,/, Mississippi/NNP ,/, Louisiana/NNP ,/, Oklahoma/NNP ,/, Montana/NNP ,/, Wyoming/NNP and/CC Alaska/NNP ./.
Overall/RB ,/, though/RB ,/, the/DT South/NNP and/CC West/NNP still/RB outpace/VBP the/DT Northeast/NNP and/CC Midwest/NNP ,/, and/CC fast-growing/JJ states/NNS like/IN Florida/NNP and/CC California/NNP ensure/VBP that/IN the/DT pattern/NN will/MD continue/VB ./.
But/CC the/DT growth/NN gap/NN between/IN the/DT Sun/NNP Belt/NNP and/CC other/JJ regions/NNS has/VBZ clearly/RB started/VBN narrowing/VBG ./.
More/JJR Elderly/JJ Maintain/VBP Their/PRP$ Independence/NN
THANKS/NNS TO/TO modern/JJ medicine/NN ,/, more/JJR couples/NNS are/VBP growing/VBG old/JJ together/RB ./.
And/CC even/RB after/IN losing/VBG a/DT spouse/NN ,/, more/JJR of/IN the/DT elderly/JJ are/VBP staying/VBG independent/JJ ./.
A/DT new/JJ Census/NNP Bureau/NNP study/NN of/IN the/DT noninstitutionalized/JJ population/NN shows/VBZ that/IN #/CD %/NN of/IN people/NNS aged/VBN #/CD to/TO #/CD were/VBD living/VBG with/IN a/DT spouse/NN in/IN #/CD ,/, up/RB from/IN #/CD %/NN in/IN #/CD ./.
This/DT does/VBZ n't/RB mean/VB they/PRP 're/VBP less/RBR likely/JJ to/TO live/VB alone/RB ,/, however/RB ./.
That/DT share/NN has/VBZ remained/VBN at/IN about/RB #/CD %/NN since/IN #/CD ./.
What/WP has/VBZ changed/VBN is/VBZ that/IN more/JJR of/IN the/DT young/JJ elderly/JJ are/VBP living/VBG with/IN spouses/NNS rather/RB than/IN with/IN other/JJ relatives/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN children/NNS ./.

As/IN people/NNS get/VB even/RB older/JJR ,/, many/JJ become/VBP widowed/JJ ./.

Like/IN their/PRP$ younger/JJR counterparts/NNS ,/, the/DT older/JJR elderly/JJ are/VBP less/RBR likely/JJ to/TO live/VB with/IN other/JJ relatives/NNS ./.

The/DT likelihood/NN of/IN living/VBG alone/RB beyond/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN #/CD has/VBZ increased/VBN to/TO #/CD %/NN from/IN #/CD %/NN ./.
More/JJR people/NNS are/VBP remaining/VBG independent/JJ longer/RBR presumably/RB because/IN they/PRP are/VBP better/JJR off/RP physically/RB and/CC financially/RB ./.
