It/PRP is/VBZ known/VBN in/IN the/DT Pentagon/NNP as/IN the/DT ``/`` negative/JJ wedge/NN ./. ''/''

To/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT Pentagon/NNP should/MD act/VB irresponsibly/RB because/IN acting/VBG responsibly/RB will/MD provoke/VB Congress/NNP into/IN acting/VBG irresponsibly/RB leads/VBZ to/TO the/DT conclusion/NN that/IN the/DT Pentagon/NNP should/MD deliberately/RB exaggerate/VB its/PRP$ needs/NNS in/IN the/DT national/JJ interest/NN ;/: in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ justified/JJ in/IN committing/VBG a/DT crime/NN --/: lying/VBG to/TO Congress/NNP --/: because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ morally/RB superior/JJ ./.
