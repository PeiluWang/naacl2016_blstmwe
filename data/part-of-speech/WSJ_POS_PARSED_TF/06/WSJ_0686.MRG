Congress/NNP sent/VBD to/TO President/NNP Bush/NNP an/DT $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD military/JJ construction/NN bill/NN that/WDT cuts/VBZ spending/NN for/IN new/JJ installations/NNS by/IN #/CD %/NN while/IN revamping/VBG the/DT Pentagon/NNP budget/NN to/TO move/VB more/JJR than/IN $/$ #/CD million/CD from/IN foreign/JJ bases/NNS to/TO home-state/JJ projects/NNS ./.

The/DT result/NN is/VBZ that/IN instead/RB of/IN the/DT Pentagon/NNP 's/POS proposed/JJ split/NN of/IN #-#/JJ between/IN domestic/JJ and/CC foreign/JJ bases/NNS ,/, the/DT reduced/JJ funding/NN is/VBZ distributed/VBN by/IN a/DT ratio/NN of/IN approximately/RB #-#/JJ ./.
The/DT extra/JJ margin/NN for/IN bases/NNS in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP enhances/VBZ the/DT power/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS committees/NNS ;/: meanwhile/RB ,/, lawmakers/NNS used/VBD their/PRP$ positions/NNS to/TO garner/VB as/RB much/JJ as/IN six/CD times/NNS what/WP the/DT Pentagon/NNP had/VBD requested/VBN for/IN their/PRP$ individual/JJ states/NNS ./.

The/DT swift/JJ passage/NN of/IN the/DT bill/NN ,/, which/WDT cleared/VBD the/DT Senate/NNP and/CC House/NNP on/IN simple/JJ voice/NN votes/NNS last/JJ week/NN ,/, contrasts/VBZ with/IN the/DT problems/NNS still/RB facing/VBG a/DT more/RBR cumbersome/JJ $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD measure/NN funding/VBG housing/NN ,/, environmental/JJ ,/, space/NN and/CC veterans/NNS programs/NNS ./.
