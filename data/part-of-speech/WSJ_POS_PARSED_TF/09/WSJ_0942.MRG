The/DT U.S./NNP ,/, in/IN a/DT far-reaching/JJ plan/NN submitted/VBN to/TO the/DT Geneva/NNP meeting/NN Tuesday/NNP ,/, proposed/VBD curbing/VBG price/NN support/NN subsidies/NNS within/IN #/CD years/NNS and/CC eliminating/VBG export/NN subsidies/NNS within/IN five/CD years/NNS ./.
U.S./NNP officials/NNS said/VBD the/DT plan/NN was/VBD flexible/JJ ,/, and/CC was/VBD intended/VBN as/IN a/DT pragmatic/JJ approach/NN for/IN gradually/RB removing/VBG trade-distorting/JJ subsidies/NNS ./.
But/CC the/DT EC/NNP reacted/VBD defiantly/RB ,/, arguing/VBG that/IN the/DT proposal/NN 's/POS main/JJ aim/NN is/VBZ to/TO destroy/VB the/DT Common/NNP Agricultural/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, the/DT EC/NNP 's/POS $/$ #/CD billion-a-year/JJ price/NN support/NN program/NN ./.

EC/NNP Agriculture/NNP Commissioner/NNP Ray/NNP MacSharry/NNP said/VBD the/DT U.S./NNP plan/NN ``/`` calls/VBZ into/IN question/NN ''/'' the/DT agreement/NN reached/VBN by/IN world/NN negotiators/NNS last/JJ April/NNP in/IN Geneva/NNP seeking/VBG ``/`` substantial/JJ progressive/JJ reductions/NNS in/IN agricultural/JJ support/NN and/CC protection/NN ./.
