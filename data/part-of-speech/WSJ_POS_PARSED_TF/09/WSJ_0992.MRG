Regarding/VBG your/PRP$ Oct./NNP #/CD page-one/NN article/NN ``/`` Bad/NNP Blood/NNP ''/'' on/IN the/DT generic-drug/JJ battle/NN :/: The/DT Epilepsy/NNP Institute/NNP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB a/DT patient-advocacy/NN organization/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ primarily/RB a/DT certified/JJ outpatient/NN treatment/NN facility/NN providing/VBG comprehensive/JJ services/NNS to/TO people/NNS with/IN epilepsy/NN and/CC their/PRP$ families/NNS ./.
The/DT institute/NN 's/POS advocacy/NN efforts/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN the/DT needs/NNS of/IN the/DT population/NN it/PRP serves/VBZ and/CC represents/VBZ ./.
In/IN #/CD ,/, the/DT Medical/NNP Tribune/NNP reported/VBD that/IN a/DT growing/VBG number/NN of/IN critics/NNS are/VBP challenging/VBG the/DT FDA/NNP bioequivalence-therapeutic-equivalence/JJ equation/NN ./.
``/`` They/PRP contend/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN an/DT assumption/NN that/WDT has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB been/VBN proven/VBN in/IN valid/JJ tests/NNS ,/, ''/'' the/DT Tribune/NNP said/VBD ./.
In/IN #/CD ,/, some/DT institute/NN patients/NNS were/VBD reporting/VBG breakthrough/NN seizures/NNS when/WRB they/PRP were/VBD switched/VBN from/IN a/DT specific/JJ brand-name/JJ medication/NN to/TO a/DT generic/JJ one/CD or/CC from/IN one/CD generic/JJ manufacturer/NN of/IN a/DT specific/JJ product/NN to/TO another/DT ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, neurologists/NNS were/VBD beginning/VBG to/TO report/VB these/DT observations/NNS as/RB well/RB ./.
Call/VB it/PRP anecdotal/JJ if/IN you/PRP will/MD ./.
But/CC no/DT ethical/JJ physician/NN would/MD switch/VB patients/NNS who/WP were/VBD doing/VBG well/RB on/IN a/DT specific/JJ medication/NN from/IN a/DT specific/JJ manufacturer/NN to/TO prove/VB a/DT point/NN ./.
We/PRP do/VBP not/RB depend/VB on/IN pharmaceutical/JJ companies/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ support/NN ./.
The/DT institute/NN has/VBZ governmental/JJ service/NN contracts/NNS for/IN the/DT provision/NN of/IN direct/JJ patient/NN services/NNS ;/: collects/VBZ patient/JJ fees/NNS ;/: receives/VBZ money/NN through/IN contributions/NNS from/IN individuals/NNS ,/, foundations/NNS and/CC bequests/NNS ./.
The/DT funds/NNS received/VBN from/IN pharmaceutical/JJ firms/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO offset/VB physician/NN symposiums/NNS ,/, and/CC these/DT symposiums/NNS do/VBP not/RB stress/VB any/DT particular/JJ medication/NN or/CC manufacturer/NN ./.
The/DT Epilepsy/NNP Institute/NNP 's/POS reporting/NN of/IN breakthrough/NN seizures/NNS stemmed/VBD from/IN concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT people/NNS we/PRP treat/VBP and/CC care/VBP about/IN daily/RB ./.
This/DT perhaps/RB was/VBD perceived/VBN as/IN a/DT ``/`` bold/JJ ''/'' stance/NN ,/, and/CC thus/RB suspicious/JJ ./.
But/CC let/VB us/PRP not/RB confuse/VB profits/NNS of/IN big/JJ business/NN masquerading/VBG as/IN concerns/NNS for/IN people/NNS 's/POS health/NN care/NN or/CC for/IN the/DT cost/NN ./.
For/IN whom/WP is/VBZ the/DT saving/NN ?/.
Surely/RB not/RB to/TO people/NNS with/IN epilepsy/NN who/WP depend/VBP on/IN the/DT same/JJ levels/NNS of/IN medication/NN in/IN their/PRP$ bloodstream/NN daily/RB to/TO maintain/VB seizure/NN control/NN ./.
