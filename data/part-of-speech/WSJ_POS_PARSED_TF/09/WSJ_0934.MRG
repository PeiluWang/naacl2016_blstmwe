The/DT Soviet/NNP State/NNP Bank/NNP announced/VBD a/DT #/CD %/NN devaluation/NN of/IN the/DT ruble/FW against/IN the/DT dollar/NN for/IN private/JJ transactions/NNS ,/, in/IN an/DT apparent/JJ attempt/NN to/TO curb/VB the/DT nation/NN 's/POS rapidly/RB growing/VBG black/JJ market/NN for/IN hard/JJ currency/NN ./.
The/DT measure/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD take/VB effect/NN next/JJ Wednesday/NNP ,/, will/MD create/VB a/DT two-tier/JJ exchange/NN rate/NN ./.

But/CC it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB elaborate/VB ,/, and/CC it/PRP remains/VBZ unclear/JJ how/WRB far/RB Western/JJ tourists/NNS and/CC foreigners/NNS living/VBG in/IN Moscow/NNP will/MD be/VB allowed/VBN to/TO benefit/VB from/IN the/DT sweeping/VBG rate/NN cut/NN ./.
The/DT current/JJ ruble/NN rate/NN has/VBZ long/RB been/VBN out/IN of/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT black/JJ market/NN ./.

Even/RB at/IN such/JJ rates/NNS ,/, black/JJ marketeers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO make/VB big/JJ profits/NNS because/IN of/IN the/DT dire/JJ shortage/NN of/IN consumer/NN goods/NNS here/RB ./.

With/IN more/JJR than/IN #/CD billion/CD rubles/NNS in/IN savings/NN accounts/NNS and/CC little/JJ to/TO spend/VB them/PRP on/IN ,/, Soviet/JJ consumers/NNS grumble/VBP at/IN the/DT exorbitant/JJ black-market/NN prices/NNS for/IN such/JJ goods/NNS --/: but/CC they/PRP buy/VBP them/PRP anyway/RB ./.

``/`` The/DT absurdity/NN of/IN the/DT official/JJ rate/NN should/MD seem/VB obvious/JJ to/TO everyone/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT afternoon/NN newspaper/NN Izvestia/NNP wrote/VBD in/IN a/DT brief/JJ commentary/NN on/IN the/DT devaluation/NN ./.
The/DT State/NNP Bank/NNP 's/POS move/NN is/VBZ part/NN of/IN a/DT drive/NN to/TO iron/VB out/RP exchange-rate/JJ discrepancies/NNS as/IN Moscow/NNP moves/VBZ toward/IN making/VBG the/DT ruble/NN convertible/JJ --/: a/DT goal/NN that/WDT Soviet/JJ bankers/NNS and/CC economists/NNS say/VBP is/VBZ still/RB far/RB away/RB ./.
