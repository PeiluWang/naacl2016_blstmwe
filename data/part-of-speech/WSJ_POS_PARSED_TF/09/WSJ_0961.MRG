Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP Chairman/NNP Alan/NNP Greenspan/NNP told/VBD Congress/NNP that/IN the/DT Fed/NNP can/MD wipe/VB out/RP inflation/NN without/IN causing/VBG a/DT recession/NN ,/, but/CC he/PRP said/VBD doing/VBG so/RB will/MD inflict/VB some/DT short-term/JJ pain/NN and/CC will/MD require/VB reducing/VBG the/DT federal/JJ deficit/NN sharply/RB ./.
Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP said/VBD he/PRP and/CC other/JJ Fed/NNP governors/NNS endorse/VBP a/DT bill/NN by/IN Rep./NNP Stephen/NNP Neal/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, N.C./NNP -RRB-/-RRB- that/WDT would/MD require/VB the/DT Fed/NNP to/TO pursue/VB policies/NNS aimed/VBN at/IN eliminating/VBG inflation/NN within/IN five/CD years/NNS ./.
``/`` Such/PDT a/DT deadline/NN is/VBZ attainable/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP would/MD have/VB costs/NNS ,/, ''/'' Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP told/VBD Rep./NNP Neal/NNP 's/POS monetary/JJ policy/NN subcommittee/NN ./.
The/DT Fed/NNP chief/NN opposed/VBD a/DT bill/NN -/: introduced/VBN by/IN Reps./NNPS Lee/NNP Hamilton/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Ind./NNP -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC Byron/NNP Dorgan/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, N.D./NNP -RRB-/-RRB- --/: that/IN ,/, among/IN other/JJ things/NNS ,/, would/MD require/VB the/DT Fed/NNP to/TO disclose/VB all/DT monetary/JJ policy/NN moves/NNS immediately/RB and/CC increase/VB outside/JJ scrutiny/NN of/IN the/DT Fed/NNP ./.
In/IN responding/VBG to/TO questions/NNS ,/, Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP played/VBD down/RP reports/NNS of/IN tension/NN between/IN the/DT Fed/NNP and/CC the/DT Treasury/NNP over/IN exchange-rate/NN policy/NN ./.
``/`` What/WP seem/VBP to/TO be/VB interpreted/VBN as/IN great/JJ conflicts/NNS are/VBP relatively/RB minor/JJ issues/NNS of/IN tactics/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.
He/PRP did/VBD n't/RB elaborate/JJ ./.
But/CC the/DT Fed/NNP is/VBZ n't/RB enthusiastic/JJ about/IN Treasury/NNP efforts/NNS to/TO bring/VB down/RP the/DT value/NN of/IN the/DT dollar/NN through/IN intervention/NN in/IN foreign-exchange/JJ markets/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT Treasury/NNP is/VBZ frustrated/VBN at/IN the/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS reluctance/NN to/TO cut/VB interest/NN rates/NNS to/TO pull/VB down/RP the/DT dollar/NN 's/POS value/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP said/VBD the/DT inflation/NN rate/NN ,/, currently/RB about/IN #/CD #$$#/CD %/NN ,/, ``/`` could/MD be/VB brought/VBN down/RP to/TO levels/NNS which/WDT are/VBP close/JJ to/TO zero/CD without/IN putting/VBG the/DT economy/NN into/IN a/DT recession/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP suspect/VB that/IN there/EX might/MD be/VB some/DT modest/JJ loss/NN of/IN economic/JJ output/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, economic/JJ growth/NN would/MD be/VB lower/JJR and/CC unemployment/NN would/MD be/VB higher/JJR for/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ./.
But/CC Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP ,/, who/WP has/VBZ repeatedly/RB said/VBN the/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO reduce/VB inflation/NN ,/, added/VBD that/IN ``/`` whatever/WDT losses/NNS are/VBP incurred/VBN in/IN the/DT pursuing/NN of/IN price/NN stability/NN would/MD surely/RB be/VB more/JJR than/IN made/VBN up/RP in/IN increased/VBN output/NN thereafter/RB ./. ''/''
He/PRP warned/VBD that/IN Fed/NNP efforts/NNS to/TO conquer/VB inflation/NN would/MD fail/VB --/: and/CC could/MD produce/VB ``/`` a/DT major/JJ financial/JJ crunch/NN ''/'' --/: unless/IN they/PRP are/VBP accompanied/VBN by/IN a/DT significant/JJ reduction/NN in/IN the/DT federal/JJ deficit/NN ,/, which/WDT causes/VBZ the/DT government/NN to/TO borrow/VB heavily/RB ./.
Rep./NNP Neal/NNP 's/POS bill/NN originally/RB called/VBD on/IN the/DT Fed/NNP to/TO reduce/VB the/DT inflation/NN rate/NN by/IN one/CD percentage/NN point/NN a/DT year/NN for/IN five/CD years/NNS and/CC to/TO maintain/VB a/DT zero/CD inflation/NN rate/NN thereafter/RB ./.
He/PRP altered/VBD the/DT wording/NN to/TO win/VB Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP 's/POS endorsement/NN ./.
Even/RB so/RB ,/, his/PRP$ bill/NN is/VBZ given/VBN little/JJ chance/NN of/IN passage/NN ./.
Reps./NNP Hamilton/NNP and/CC Dorgan/NNP also/RB have/VBP altered/VBN their/PRP$ bill/NN ,/, dropping/VBG a/DT proposal/NN to/TO add/VB the/DT Treasury/NNP secretary/NN to/TO the/DT #-member/JJ Fed/NNP committee/NN that/WDT makes/VBZ monetary/JJ policy/NN ./.
Instead/RB ,/, the/DT bill/NN simply/RB calls/VBZ for/IN twice-a-year/JJ meetings/NNS between/IN the/DT committee/NN and/CC top/JJ administration/NN officials/NNS ./.
Even/RB that/DT met/VBD with/IN Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP 's/POS disapproval/NN because/IN it/PRP might/MD subject/VB the/DT Fed/NNP ``/`` to/TO a/DT more/RBR intensely/RB political/JJ perspective/NN ''/'' and/CC ``/`` could/MD risk/VB bending/VBG monetary/JJ policy/NN away/RB from/IN long-term/JJ strategic/JJ goals/NNS ./.

Mr./NNP Greenspan/NNP also/RB said/VBD that/IN although/IN he/PRP favors/VBZ cutting/VBG capital-gains/NNS taxes/NNS as/IN sound/JJ economic/JJ policy/NN ,/, he/PRP would/MD oppose/VB such/PDT a/DT move/NN if/IN it/PRP would/MD undo/VB the/DT political/JJ compromise/NN embodied/VBN in/IN the/DT Tax/NNP Reform/NNP Act/NNP of/IN #/CD and/CC result/VB in/IN higher/JJR marginal/JJ income/NN tax/NN rates/NNS ./.
