The/DT White/NNP House/NNP has/VBZ decided/VBN to/TO push/VB for/IN changes/NNS in/IN pesticide/NN law/NN that/WDT are/VBP designed/VBN to/TO speed/VB the/DT removal/NN of/IN harmful/JJ chemicals/NNS from/IN the/DT nation/NN 's/POS food/NN supply/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN changes/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP scheduled/VBN to/TO be/VB announced/VBN today/NN ,/, would/MD apply/VB to/TO pesticides/NNS and/CC other/JJ substances/NNS found/VBN on/IN fresh/JJ and/CC processed/VBN foods/NNS ,/, according/VBG to/TO federal/JJ officials/NNS ./.
Environmental/JJ groups/NNS have/VBP been/VBN calling/VBG for/IN faster/JJR action/NN on/IN dangerous/JJ pesticides/NNS and/CC may/MD welcome/VB part/NN of/IN the/DT proposal/NN ./.
But/CC they/PRP are/VBP already/RB objecting/VBG to/TO ,/, among/IN other/JJ things/NNS ,/, a/DT plan/NN to/TO give/VB more/JJR weight/NN to/TO cost-benefit/JJ considerations/NNS in/IN evaluating/VBG pesticides/NNS ./.
``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT tremendous/JJ disappointment/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Janet/NNP Hathaway/NNP ,/, an/DT attorney/NN with/IN the/DT Natural/NNP Resources/NNPS Defense/NNP Council/NNP ./.
``/`` Allowing/VBG the/DT EPA/NNP to/TO condone/VB continued/VBN use/NN of/IN a/DT chemical/NN whenever/WRB the/DT benefits/NNS outweigh/VBP the/DT risks/NNS is/VBZ absolutely/RB anathema/NN to/TO the/DT environmental/JJ community/NN ./. ''/''
The/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN plans/VBZ to/TO announce/VB a/DT series/NN of/IN principles/NNS and/CC to/TO work/VB with/IN congressional/JJ leaders/NNS in/IN writing/VBG specific/JJ legislative/JJ proposals/NNS that/WDT embody/VBP them/PRP ./.
The/DT principles/NNS would/MD give/VB the/DT Environmental/NNP Protection/NNP Agency/NNP increased/VBN authority/NN and/CC flexibility/NN in/IN regulating/VBG pesticides/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN enabling/VBG the/DT agency/NN to/TO move/VB more/RBR quickly/RB ./.
There/EX already/RB are/VBP proposals/NNS pending/VBG in/IN Congress/NNP to/TO overhaul/VB pesticide/NN law/NN ./.
Moves/NNS to/TO accelerate/VB the/DT removal/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ pesticides/NNS gained/VBD new/JJ impetus/NN during/IN this/DT year/NN 's/POS Alar/NNP scare/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT EPA/NNP was/VBD harshly/RB criticized/VBN for/IN failing/VBG to/TO yank/VB the/DT possible/JJ carcinogen/NN ,/, a/DT growth/NN regulator/NN used/VBN to/TO make/VB apples/NNS redder/JJR and/CC crunchier/JJR ./.
The/DT agency/NN has/VBZ since/IN acted/VBN to/TO remove/VB Alar/NNP from/IN the/DT nation/NN 's/POS grocery/NN shelves/NNS by/IN May/NNP #/CD ,/, #/CD ,/, and/CC the/DT apple/NN industry/NN has/VBZ said/VBN that/IN growers/NNS already/RB have/VBP stopped/VBN using/VBG the/DT chemical/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT principles/NNS attempt/VBP to/TO eliminate/VB the/DT so-called/JJ Delaney/NNP Paradox/NNP ./.
Under/IN the/DT Delaney/NNP clause/NN ,/, which/WDT applies/VBZ to/TO processed/VBN food/NN ,/, a/DT chemical/NN is/VBZ banned/VBN if/IN it/PRP causes/VBZ cancer/NN in/IN laboratory/NN animals/NNS ./.
Under/IN other/JJ laws/NNS applying/VBG to/TO pesticide/NN use/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, that/DT same/JJ chemical/NN could/MD be/VB allowed/VBN to/TO be/VB used/VBN on/IN fresh/JJ food/NN if/IN it/PRP fell/VBD within/IN the/DT EPA/NNP 's/POS tolerance/NN level/NN ./.
Among/IN other/JJ changes/NNS ,/, the/DT White/NNP House/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO :/:
--/: Give/VB the/DT EPA/NNP more/JJR flexibility/NN to/TO declare/VB a/DT pesticide/NN an/DT imminent/JJ hazard/NN and/CC pull/VB it/PRP from/IN the/DT marketplace/NN ./.

--/: Bar/VB states/NNS from/IN setting/VBG more/RBR stringent/JJ tolerance/NN levels/NNS for/IN a/DT pesticide/NN once/IN the/DT federal/JJ government/NN has/VBZ set/VBN a/DT standard/NN ./.
--/: Give/VB the/DT EPA/NNP added/VBN discretion/NN to/TO set/VB ``/`` negligible/JJ risk/NN ''/'' levels/NNS for/IN pesticide/NN residues/NNS in/IN processed/VBN food/NN ./.
Chemicals/NNS that/WDT exceed/VBP these/DT risk/NN levels/NNS would/MD be/VB barred/VBN ,/, but/CC those/DT that/WDT fall/VBP below/IN these/DT levels/NNS would/MD be/VB allowed/VBN ./.
--/: Allow/VB the/DT EPA/NNP to/TO permit/VB the/DT continued/VBN use/NN of/IN pesticides/NNS that/WDT exceed/VBP its/PRP$ negligible/JJ risk/NN standard/NN if/IN the/DT benefits/NNS of/IN doing/VBG so/RB outweigh/VB the/DT cost/NN ./.
