Garry/NNP Kasparov/NNP went/VBD to/TO combat/VB Sunday/NNP with/IN the/DT world/NN 's/POS most/RBS advanced/VBN chess/NN computer/NN and/CC kicked/VBD it/PRP around/RB --/: symbolically/RB ,/, anyway/RB --/: like/IN an/DT old/JJ tin/NN can/NN ./.
Playing/VBG black/JJ in/IN the/DT first/JJ game/NN ,/, the/DT human/JJ champion/NN maneuvered/VBD Deep/NNP Thought/NNP ,/, known/VBN for/IN its/PRP$ attacking/VBG prowess/NN ,/, into/IN a/DT totally/RB passive/JJ position/NN ./.
Then/RB he/PRP unleashed/VBD his/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, unstoppable/JJ ,/, attack/NN ./.
And/CC in/IN the/DT second/JJ game/NN ,/, with/IN Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP advancing/VBG ferociously/RB as/IN white/JJ ,/, D.T./NNP offered/VBD feeble/JJ resistance/NN and/CC lost/VBD even/RB faster/RBR ./.
Well/UH ,/, mankind/NN can/MD rest/VB easier/JJR for/IN now/RB ./.
Though/IN almost/RB everybody/NN at/IN the/DT playing/VBG site/NN had/VBD been/VBN looking/VBG for/IN the/DT #-year-old/JJ Soviet/NNP to/TO beat/VB the/DT Pennsylvania-based/JJ computer/NN ,/, he/PRP gave/VBD the/DT machine/NN a/DT far/RB worse/JJR drubbing/NN than/IN many/JJ expected/VBD ./.
And/CC when/WRB Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP strode/VBD into/IN the/DT playing/VBG hall/NN ,/, he/PRP called/VBD the/DT outcome/NN ./.
As/IN if/IN he/PRP were/VBD Iron/NNP Mike/NNP ,/, about/IN to/TO enter/VB the/DT ring/NN with/IN a/DT #-pound/JJ weakling/NN ,/, he/PRP declared/VBD :/: ``/`` I/PRP 'll/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO beat/VB any/DT computer/NN for/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS ./. ''/''
His/PRP$ strategy/NN against/IN D.T./NNP was/VBD based/VBN on/IN a/DT thorough/JJ study/NN of/IN dozens/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ games/NNS ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, including/VBG its/PRP$ notorious/JJ whippings/NNS of/IN the/DT grandmasters/NNS Bent/NNP Larsen/NNP of/IN Denmark/NNP and/CC Robert/NNP Byrne/NNP of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ./.
Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP was/VBD underwhelmed/VBN ./.
``/`` The/DT computer/NN 's/POS mind/NN is/VBZ too/RB straight/JJ ,/, too/RB primitive/JJ ,/, ''/'' lacking/VBG the/DT intuition/NN and/CC creativity/NN needed/VBN to/TO reach/VB the/DT top/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ./.
The/DT champion/NN apparently/RB was/VBD not/RB worried/VBN at/IN all/DT about/IN D.T./NNP 's/POS strong/JJ points/NNS ./.
Its/PRP$ chief/NN builder/NN ,/, Taiwan-born/JJ Feng-hsiung/NNP Hsu/NNP ,/, nicknamed/VBN his/PRP$ brainchild/NN ``/`` the/DT Weasel/NNP ''/'' for/IN its/PRP$ tactical/JJ flair/NN at/IN wriggling/VBG out/IN of/IN horrible/JJ positions/NNS ./.
D.T./NNP also/RB has/VBZ a/DT prodigious/JJ and/CC flawless/JJ memory/NN ,/, is/VBZ utterly/RB fearless/JJ ,/, and/CC could/MD n't/RB be/VB distracted/VBN by/IN the/DT sexy/JJ nude/JJ sculptures/NNS spread/VBN around/IN the/DT playing/NN hall/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT New/NNP York/NNP Academy/NNP of/IN Art/NNP ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, D.T./NNP never/RB left/VBD home/NN ,/, Carnegie/NNP Mellon/NNP University/NNP in/IN Pittsburgh/NNP ,/, but/CC communicated/VBN with/IN its/PRP$ human/JJ handlers/NNS by/IN telephone/NN link/NN ./.
They/PRP conceded/VBD that/IN the/DT odds/NNS favored/VBD Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP ,/, but/CC they/PRP put/VBP their/PRP$ hope/NN in/IN D.T./NNP 's/POS recently/RB enhanced/VBN capacity/NN for/IN examining/VBG positions/NNS --/: up/IN to/TO a/DT million/CD per/IN second/JJ ,/, from/IN #,#/CD ./.
But/CC the/DT handlers/NNS mistakenly/RB stuck/VBD with/IN silicon/NN chips/NNS ;/: they/PRP needed/VBD kryptonite/NN ./.
This/DT became/VBD apparent/JJ as/IN game/NN one/CD ,/, a/DT Sicilian/NNP Defense/NNP by/IN Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP ,/, proceeded/VBD ./.
No/DT human/NN can/MD examine/VB millions/NNS of/IN moves/NNS ,/, but/CC Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP ,/, using/VBG his/PRP$ ineffably/RB powerful/JJ brain/NN ,/, consistently/RB found/VBD very/RB good/JJ ones/NNS ./.
After/IN eight/CD moves/NNS by/IN each/DT side/NN ,/, the/DT board/NN was/VBD the/DT same/JJ as/IN in/IN a/DT game/NN in/IN which/WDT Nigel/NNP Short/NNP of/IN Great/NNP Britain/NNP fought/VBD the/DT champion/NN to/TO a/DT draw/NN in/IN #/CD ./.
But/CC the/DT computer/NN did/VBD n't/RB play/VB Mr./NNP Short/NNP 's/POS ninth/JJ move/NN ,/, a/DT key/JJ pawn/NN thrust/NN ,/, and/CC its/PRP$ position/NN deteriorated/VBD rapidly/RB ./.
Instead/RB of/IN castling/VBG ,/, a/DT standard/JJ measure/NN to/TO safeguard/VB the/DT king/NN ,/, D.T./NNP made/VBD a/DT second-rate/JJ rook/NN maneuver/NN at/IN move/NN #/CD ;/: then/RB it/PRP put/VBD a/DT knight/NN offside/NN on/IN move/NN #/CD ./.
``/`` Only/RB two/CD classes/NNS of/IN minds/NNS would/MD think/VB of/IN this/DT --/: very/RB weak/JJ human/JJ players/NNS ,/, and/CC computers/NNS ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Edmar/NNP Mednis/NNP ,/, the/DT expert/JJ commentator/NN for/IN the/DT match/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD attended/VBN by/IN hundreds/NNS of/IN chess/NN fans/NNS ./.
By/IN move/NN #/CD ,/, D.T./NNP had/VBD fallen/VBN into/IN a/DT deep/JJ positional/JJ trap/NN ./.
It/PRP allowed/VBD Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP to/TO exchange/VB his/PRP$ dark-squared/JJ bishop/NN for/IN one/CD of/IN D.T./NNP 's/POS knights/NNS ./.
Bishops/NNS usually/RB are/VBP worth/JJ slightly/RB more/JJR than/IN knights/NNS ,/, but/CC in/IN this/DT case/NN Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP was/VBD left/VBN with/IN a/DT very/RB dangerous/JJ knight/NN and/CC D.T./NNP 's/POS surviving/VBG bishop/NN was/VBD reduced/VBN to/TO passivity/NN ./.
Indeed/RB ,/, it/PRP looked/VBD more/JJR like/IN a/DT pawn/NN ,/, a/DT ``/`` tall/JJ pawn/NN ,/, ''/'' as/IN spectators/NNS snidely/RB put/VBP it/PRP ./.
Consistently/RB ,/, D.T./NNP was/VBD over-optimistic/JJ about/IN its/PRP$ chances/NNS ,/, which/WDT it/PRP continually/RB sized/VBD up/RP ,/, in/IN numerical/JJ form/NN ./.
When/WRB most/JJS spectators/NNS thought/VBD its/PRP$ position/NN hopeless/JJ ,/, the/DT computer/NN thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD only/RB ,/, in/IN effect/NN ,/, one-half/NN of/IN a/DT pawn/NN down/IN ./.
Such/JJ evaluations/NNS met/VBD with/IN derision/NN ,/, and/CC kept/VBD the/DT machine/NN from/IN resigning/VBG as/RB soon/RB as/IN humans/NNS would/MD have/VB --/: prompting/VBG more/JJR derision/NN ./.
While/IN D.T./NNP shuffled/VBD its/PRP$ king/NN back/RB and/CC forth/RB in/IN a/DT defensive/JJ crouch/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP maneuvered/VBD the/DT knight/NN to/TO a/DT dominant/JJ outpost/NN ./.
He/PRP also/RB launched/VBD a/DT kingside/NN storm/NN ,/, sacrificing/VBG a/DT pawn/NN to/TO denude/VB D.T./NNP 's/POS king/NN ./.
No/DT amount/NN of/IN weasling/VBG could/MD have/VB saved/VBN this/DT game/NN for/IN D.T/NNP ./.
A/DT piece/NN down/IN ,/, the/DT computer/NN resigned/VBD ./.
Now/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT crowd/NN in/IN the/DT analysis/NN room/NN smelling/VBG figurative/JJ blood/NN ,/, the/DT only/JJ question/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB how/WRB fast/JJ Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP could/MD win/VB game/NN two/CD ./.
With/IN the/DT advantage/NN of/IN playing/VBG white/JJ -LRB-/-LRB- which/WDT moves/VBZ first/JJ -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP followed/VBD up/RP cleverly/RB against/IN the/DT computer/NN 's/POS defense/NN ,/, a/DT Queen/NNP 's/POS Gambit/NNP Accepted/NNP ./.
As/RB early/RB as/IN move/NN six/CD ,/, Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP deviated/VBD from/IN a/DT well-known/JJ sequence/NN of/IN moves/NNS ,/, developing/VBG a/DT knight/NN instead/RB of/IN making/VBG a/DT standard/JJ bishop/NN attack/NN against/IN the/DT computer/NN 's/POS advanced/VBN knight/NN ./.
This/DT left/VBD the/DT computer/NN with/IN a/DT broader/JJR range/NN of/IN plausible/JJ replies/NNS --/: and/CC it/PRP immediately/RB blundered/VBD by/IN moving/VBG a/DT queenside/NN pawn/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT neglect/NN of/IN kingside/NN development/NN ./.
``/`` In/IN a/DT new/JJ position/NN just/RB after/IN the/DT opening/NN ,/, a/DT computer/NN will/MD have/VB serious/JJ problems/NNS ,/, ''/'' Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP said/VBD later/RB ./.
In/IN such/JJ positions/NNS ,/, he/PRP explained/VBD ,/, ``/`` you/PRP have/VBP to/TO create/VB something/NN new/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT computer/NN is/VBZ n't/RB able/JJ to/TO do/VB that/DT right/RB now/RB ./. ''/''
After/IN only/RB #/CD moves/NNS for/IN each/DT side/NN ,/, the/DT computer/NN 's/POS position/NN was/VBD shaky/JJ ./.
Greedily/RB ,/, it/PRP grabbed/VBD a/DT pawn/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN facing/VBG a/DT brutal/JJ attack/NN ./.
And/CC when/WRB a/DT defensive/JJ move/NN was/VBD called/VBN for/IN ,/, D.T./NNP passed/VBD up/RP an/DT obvious/JJ pawn/NN move/NN and/CC instead/RB exposed/VBN its/PRP$ queen/NN to/TO immediate/JJ tactical/JJ threats/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP remarked/VBD later/RB that/IN ``/`` even/RB a/DT weak/JJ club/NN player/NN ''/'' would/MD have/VB avoided/VBN the/DT queen/NN move/NN ./.
Now/RB ,/, after/IN only/RB a/DT dozen/NN moves/NNS ,/, spectators/NNS were/VBD looking/VBG for/IN a/DT mating/NN combination/NN ./.
On/IN a/DT demonstration/NN board/NN ,/, emcee/NN Shelby/NNP Lyman/NNP showed/VBD a/DT quick/JJ kill/NN initiated/VBN by/IN a/DT knight/NN sacrifice/NN ;/: no/DT spectator/NN refuted/VBD this/DT line/NN of/IN play/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP 's/POS continuation/NN was/VBD slower/JJR but/CC ,/, in/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, just/RB as/IN deadly/JJ ./.
He/PRP won/VBD D.T./NNP 's/POS queen/NN for/IN two/CD minor/JJ pieces/NNS and/CC two/CD pawns/NNS --/: not/RB enough/RB compensation/NN ,/, in/IN this/DT position/NN ,/, to/TO give/VB the/DT computer/NN much/JJ hope/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT hopeless/JJ position/NN ,/, the/DT computer/NN resigned/VBD rather/RB than/IN make/VB its/PRP$ #th/JJ move/NN ./.
And/CC Mr./NNP Kasparov/NNP ,/, to/TO cheers/NNS and/CC applause/NN ,/, marched/VBD back/RB into/IN the/DT analysis/NN room/NN ./.
``/`` In/IN both/DT games/NNS I/PRP got/VBD exactly/RB what/WP I/PRP wanted/VBD ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.
What/WP he/PRP had/VBD demonstrated/VBN ,/, he/PRP added/VBD ,/, is/VBZ that/IN there/EX 's/VBZ more/JJR to/TO chess/NN than/IN sheer/JJ calculation/NN ./.
Undeterred/JJ ,/, D.T./NNP 's/POS handlers/NNS vowed/VBD to/TO press/VB on/IN ./.
