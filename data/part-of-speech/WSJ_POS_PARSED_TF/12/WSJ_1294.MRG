Since/IN the/DT bureau/NN 's/POS estimates/NNS for/IN the/DT business/NN sector/NN provide/VBP the/DT numerator/NN for/IN the/DT productivity/NN ratios/NNS calculated/VBN by/IN the/DT Department/NNP of/IN Labor/NNP ,/, underestimated/VBN growth/NN rates/NNS artificially/RB depress/VBP official/JJ productivity/NN statistics/NNS ./.
If/IN this/DT thesis/NN is/VBZ correct/JJ ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ important/JJ implications/NNS for/IN macroeconomic/JJ policies/NNS :/: It/PRP may/MD lower/VB the/DT sense/NN of/IN urgency/NN behind/IN efforts/NNS to/TO enact/VB tax/NN incentives/NNS and/CC other/JJ measures/NNS to/TO increase/VB the/DT rate/NN of/IN growth/NN in/IN productivity/NN and/CC real/JJ GNP/NNP ./.
It/PRP would/MD also/RB affect/VB the/DT perceptions/NNS of/IN the/DT board/NN of/IN governors/NNS of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP System/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT informed/VBN public/NN generally/RB ,/, as/IN to/TO what/WP constitutes/VBZ a/DT reasonable/JJ degree/NN of/IN price/NN stability/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT early/JJ #s/CD ,/, I/PRP predicted/VBD a/DT significant/JJ acceleration/NN in/IN productivity/NN growth/NN over/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT decade/NN ./.
This/DT forecast/NN was/VBD based/VBN on/IN the/DT apparent/JJ reversal/NN of/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT negative/JJ forces/NNS --/: such/JJ as/IN demographic/JJ changes/NNS ,/, the/DT oil/NN shock/NN and/CC accelerating/VBG inflation/NN --/: that/WDT had/VBD reduced/VBN productivity/NN gains/NNS in/IN the/DT #s/CD ./.
There/EX has/VBZ indeed/RB been/VBN more/JJR than/IN a/DT one/CD percentage/NN point/NN improvement/NN in/IN productivity/NN growth/NN since/IN #/CD ./.

The/DT evidence/NN does/VBZ not/RB clearly/RB support/VB the/DT view/NN that/IN the/DT downward/JJ bias/NN in/IN output/NN growth/NN has/VBZ become/VBN greater/JJR during/IN the/DT #-#/CD period/NN ,/, but/CC all/DT I/PRP am/VBP claiming/VBG is/VBZ that/IN the/DT growth/NN trend/NN is/VBZ understated/VBN ./.
-LRB-/-LRB- It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, possible/JJ ,/, that/IN further/JJ study/NN will/MD reveal/VB increasing/VBG bias/NN ./. -RRB-/-RRB-
This/DT bias/NN is/VBZ in/IN no/DT way/NN deliberate/JJ ./.
The/DT understatement/NN of/IN growth/NN is/VBZ due/JJ largely/RB to/TO the/DT conservative/JJ expedients/NNS adopted/VBN to/TO deal/VB with/IN deficiencies/NNS in/IN basic/JJ economic/JJ data/NNS ./.
The/DT first/JJ of/IN three/CD major/JJ sources/NNS of/IN error/NN is/VBZ the/DT use/NN of/IN labor/NN input/NN estimates/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- mainly/RB employment/NN or/CC hours/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- instead/RB of/IN output/NN estimates/NNS for/IN those/DT sectors/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN governments/NNS ,/, paid/VBN household/NN services/NNS and/CC private/JJ non-profit/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, where/WRB there/EX are/VBP difficulties/NNS in/IN assembling/VBG output/NN data/NNS ./.
This/DT means/VBZ that/IN no/DT allowance/NN is/VBZ made/VBN for/IN possible/JJ increases/NNS in/IN output/NN per/IN unit/NN of/IN labor/NN ./.
In/IN an/DT unrelated/JJ program/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT Labor/NNP Department/NNP does/VBZ estimate/VB output/NN per/IN employee/NN for/IN more/JJR than/IN two-thirds/NNS of/IN federal/JJ civilian/JJ employees/NNS ,/, it/PRP found/VBD an/DT average/JJ annual/JJ rate/NN of/IN productivity/NN improvement/NN of/IN #.#/CD %/NN during/IN the/DT #s/CD ./.
Even/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ assumed/VBN that/IN productivity/NN rose/VBD no/RB more/RBR than/IN half/DT as/RB quickly/RB in/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT nonbusiness/NN sector/NN ,/, this/DT Labor/NNP Department/NNP estimate/NN indicates/VBZ a/DT downward/JJ bias/NN in/IN the/DT real/JJ GNP/NNP estimates/NNS of/IN #.#/CD percentage/NN point/NN a/DT year/NN ,/, on/IN average/NN ./.
The/DT federal/JJ productivity/NN estimators/NNS use/VBP labor/NN input/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN output/NN ,/, data/NNS for/IN their/PRP$ calculations/NNS of/IN half/DT of/IN private/JJ financial/JJ and/CC service/NN industries/NNS as/RB well/RB ./.
Independent/JJ estimates/NNS of/IN output/NN in/IN those/DT industries/NNS ,/, including/VBG one/CD by/IN the/DT Department/NNP of/IN Labor/NNP for/IN banking/NN ,/, suggests/VBZ that/DT productivity/NN in/IN finance/NN and/CC services/NNS appears/VBZ to/TO have/VB risen/VBN by/IN an/DT average/NN of/IN at/IN least/JJS #.#/CD %/NN a/DT year/NN between/IN #/CD and/CC #/CD ./.
Because/IN finance/NN and/CC services/NNS contribute/VBP #/CD %/NN to/TO final/JJ business/NN product/NN ,/, missing/VBG these/DT productivity/NN improvements/NNS depresses/VBZ the/DT overall/JJ growth/NN rate/NN by/IN #.#/CD %/NN a/DT year/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ source/NN of/IN error/NN in/IN growth/NN statistics/NNS is/VBZ the/DT use/NN of/IN inappropriate/JJ deflators/NNS to/TO adjust/VB for/IN price/NN changes/NNS ./.
I/PRP estimate/VBP that/IN these/DT mismeasurements/NNS as/IN detailed/VBN by/IN Martin/NNP N./NNP Baily/NNP and/CC Robert/NNP J./NNP Gordon/NNP add/VB a/DT further/JJ #.#/CD percentage/NN point/NN to/TO the/DT downward/JJ bias/NN in/IN the/DT growth/NN rate/NN of/IN real/JJ business/NN product/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, the/DT official/JJ estimates/NNS understate/VBP growth/NN because/IN they/PRP make/VBP inadequate/JJ allowance/NN for/IN improvements/NNS in/IN quality/NN of/IN goods/NNS and/CC services/NNS ./.
In/IN #/CD ,/, a/DT new/JJ price/NN index/NN for/IN computers/NNS adjusted/VBN for/IN changes/NNS in/IN performance/NN characteristics/NNS was/VBD introduced/VBN ,/, and/CC that/WDT resulted/VBD in/IN a/DT significantly/RB larger/JJR increase/NN in/IN real/JJ outlays/NNS for/IN durable/JJ goods/NNS than/IN the/DT earlier/JJR estimates/NNS had/VBD showed/VBN ./.
Since/IN then/RB ,/, further/JJ research/NN argues/VBZ that/DT failure/NN to/TO take/VB account/NN of/IN quality/NN improvements/NNS has/VBZ contributed/VBN a/DT total/NN of/IN at/IN least/JJS #.#/CD percentage/NN point/NN to/TO the/DT downward/JJ bias/NN in/IN the/DT growth/NN rate/NN ./.
In/IN sum/NN ,/, the/DT biases/NNS ennumerated/VBD above/IN indicate/VBP a/DT #.#/CD percentage/NN point/NN understatement/NN in/IN growth/NN of/IN total/JJ real/JJ GNP/NNP ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, the/DT growth/NN rates/NNS of/IN both/DT total/NN GNP/NNP and/CC real/JJ private/JJ business/NN product/NN per/IN labor/NN hour/NN have/VBP been/VBN underestimated/VBN by/IN about/IN #/CD %/NN ./.
