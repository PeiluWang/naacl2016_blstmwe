The/DT surprise/NN resignation/NN yesterday/NN of/IN British/NNP Chancellor/NNP of/IN the/DT Exchequer/NNP Nigel/NNP Lawson/NNP sent/VBD sterling/NN into/IN a/DT tailspin/NN against/IN the/DT dollar/NN by/IN creating/VBG uncertainties/NNS about/IN the/DT direction/NN of/IN the/DT British/JJ economy/NN ./.
