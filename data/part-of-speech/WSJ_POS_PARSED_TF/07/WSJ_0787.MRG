Treasury/NNP Secretary/NNP Nicholas/NNP Brady/NNP said/VBD that/IN Congress/NNP should/MD grant/VB the/DT Securities/NNPS and/CC Exchange/NNP Commission/NNP the/DT power/NN to/TO close/VB the/DT stock/NN markets/NNS in/IN periods/NNS of/IN crisis/NN ./.
In/IN testimony/NN to/TO the/DT Senate/NNP securities/NNS subcommittee/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Brady/NNP disputed/VBD the/DT view/NN of/IN SEC/NNP Chairman/NNP Richard/NNP Breeden/NNP ,/, who/WP told/VBD a/DT House/NNP panel/NN Wednesday/NNP that/IN he/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB want/VB the/DT ability/NN to/TO halt/VB the/DT markets/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Breeden/NNP contended/VBD that/DT discretionary/JJ power/NN could/MD have/VB an/DT impact/NN on/IN the/DT markets/NNS if/IN rumors/NNS were/VBD to/TO circulate/VB about/IN when/WRB the/DT exchanges/NNS might/MD be/VB closed/VBN ./.

Separately/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Brady/NNP said/VBD he/PRP asked/VBD the/DT Working/NNP Group/NNP on/IN Financial/NNP Markets/NNPS to/TO determine/VB whether/IN futures/NNS margins/NNS are/VBP too/RB low/JJ ./.
He/PRP noted/VBD that/IN some/DT minimum/NN margin/NN requirements/NNS have/VBP been/VBN reduced/VBN to/TO levels/NNS below/IN those/DT before/IN the/DT #/CD crash/NN ./.
``/`` This/DT raises/VBZ questions/NNS whether/IN futures/NNS and/CC equity/NN margin/NN requirements/NNS are/VBP consistent/JJ at/IN these/DT levels/NNS and/CC whether/IN futures/NNS margins/NNS are/VBP adequate/JJ ,/, ''/'' Mr./NNP Brady/NNP said/VBD ./.

Mr./NNP Brady/NNP also/RB agreed/VBD with/IN senators/NNS '/POS concerns/NNS about/IN recent/JJ stock-market/NN volatility/NN ,/, and/CC said/VBD he/PRP realizes/VBZ that/IN the/DT gyrations/NNS are/VBP scaring/VBG investors/NNS from/IN investing/VBG in/IN stocks/NNS ./.

The/DT former/JJ Wall/NNP Street/NNP executive/NN refused/VBD to/TO offer/VB an/DT opinion/NN on/IN the/DT controversy/NN surrounding/VBG program/NN trading/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ recently/RB become/VBN a/DT larger/JJR part/NN of/IN the/DT trading/NN in/IN the/DT market/NN and/CC has/VBZ been/VBN blamed/VBN for/IN accelerating/VBG the/DT drop/NN two/CD weeks/NNS ago/RB ./.
