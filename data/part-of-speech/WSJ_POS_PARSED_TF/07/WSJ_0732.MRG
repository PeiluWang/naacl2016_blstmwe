Why/WRB do/VBP you/PRP continually/RB ignore/VB the/DT salubrious/JJ effects/NNS of/IN indexing/VBG the/DT basis/NN of/IN capital/NN gains/NNS for/IN inflation/NN ?/.
Why/WRB do/VBP you/PRP maintain/VB the/DT House-passed/JJ capital-gains/NNS plan/NN is/VBZ a/DT ``/`` temporary/JJ ''/'' reduction/NN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB ?/.
I/PRP think/VBP the/DT reason/NN is/VBZ that/IN you/PRP are/VBP confusing/VBG tax/NN ``/`` rates/NNS ''/'' with/IN tax/NN ``/`` payments/NNS ./. ''/''
Your/PRP$ Sept./NNP #/CD page-one/NN story/NN on/IN the/DT House-passed/JJ capital-gains/NNS plan/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ example/NN ./.
You/PRP lead/VBP readers/NNS to/TO believe/VB that/IN the/DT House/NNP reduced/VBD the/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN for/IN two/CD years/NNS only/RB ./.
You/PRP virtually/RB ignore/VBP the/DT tax-reducing/VBG power/NN of/IN indexation/NN ,/, which/WDT in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS is/VBZ more/RBR substantial/JJ than/IN a/DT lower/JJR rate/NN ./.
The/DT monetary/JJ tax/NN benefit/NN of/IN indexation/NN for/IN all/DT gains/NNS in/IN excess/NN of/IN inflation/NN can/MD be/VB measured/VBN using/VBG the/DT following/JJ equation/NN :/: tax/NN rate/NN ,/, times/CC inflation/NN rate/NN ,/, times/CC basis/NN for/IN the/DT gain/NN ./.
Depending/VBG on/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT gain/NN and/CC the/DT rate/NN of/IN inflation/NN ,/, indexation/NN can/MD mean/VB a/DT lower/JJR tax/NN payment/NN than/IN using/VBG the/DT #.#/CD %/NN rate/NN without/IN indexation/NN ./.
But/CC in/IN any/DT event/NN --/: and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT important/JJ point/NN --/: tax/NN ``/`` payments/NNS ''/'' on/IN capital/NN gains/NNS will/MD be/VB lower/JJR with/IN indexation/NN than/IN under/IN current/JJ law/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN the/DT tax/NN ``/`` rate/NN ''/'' is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ under/IN both/DT systems/NNS ./.
As/IN you/PRP can/MD see/VB ,/, the/DT capital-gains/NNS reduction/NN plan/NN adopted/VBN by/IN the/DT House/NNP would/MD not/RB be/VB temporary/JJ ,/, but/CC permanent/JJ ./.
I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN you/PRP begin/VB talking/VBG about/IN the/DT plan/NN 's/POS permanent/JJ and/CC ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, most/RBS beneficial/JJ feature/NN --/: indexation/NN ./.

That/IN the/DT motivation/NN for/IN the/DT two-year/JJ reduction/NN to/TO #.#/CD %/NN is/VBZ budgetary/JJ does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB in/IN the/DT public/JJ interest/NN ./.
The/DT reduction/NN eases/VBZ the/DT burden/NN on/IN portfolio/NN changes/NNS and/CC frees/VBZ capital/NN to/TO seek/VB more/RBR productive/JJ or/CC more/RBR appropriate/JJ uses/NNS ./.
