On/IN June/NNP #/CD ,/, a/DT major/JJ part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ trade/NN deficit/NN went/VBD poof/NN !/.
No/DT figure/NN juggling/NN ;/: no/DT witchcraft/NN ;/: just/RB vastly/RB improved/VBN recording/NN of/IN some/DT of/IN our/PRP$ exports/NNS ./.
The/DT result/NN ?/.
The/DT Commerce/NNP Department/NNP found/VBD that/IN U.S./NNP exports/NNS in/IN #/CD ,/, net/NN of/IN imports/NNS ,/, were/VBD understated/VBN by/IN $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD a/DT year/NN and/CC understated/VBD at/IN the/DT annualized/VBN rate/NN of/IN $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD in/IN the/DT first/JJ quarter/NN of/IN #/CD ./.
More/RBR than/IN half/NN of/IN the/DT ``/`` newly/RB found/VBN ''/'' net/JJ exports/NNS were/VBD from/IN just/RB a/DT few/JJ service-sector/JJ categories/NNS ./.
Some/DT of/IN the/DT biggest/JJS service-industry/JJ exporters/NNS --/: American/JJ financial-service/JJ companies/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN --/: have/VBP yet/RB to/TO be/VB fully/RB included/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ export/NN statistics/NNS ./.
Nearly/RB #/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, representatives/NNS of/IN service-sector/JJ companies/NNS worked/VBN out/RP a/DT plan/NN with/IN the/DT Commerce/NNP Department/NNP to/TO improve/VB the/DT data/NN on/IN service-sector/JJ exports/NNS ./.
Both/DT groups/NNS believed/VBD that/IN tens/NNS of/IN billions/NNS of/IN dollars/NNS of/IN service/NN exports/NNS --/: such/JJ as/IN inbound/JJ tourism/NN ;/: legal/JJ ,/, accounting/NN and/CC other/JJ professional/JJ services/NNS furnished/VBN to/TO foreigners/NNS ;/: financial/JJ ,/, engineering/NN and/CC construction/NN services/NNS ;/: and/CC the/DT like/JJ --/: were/VBD not/RB being/VBG counted/VBN as/IN exports/NNS ./.
The/DT monthly/JJ ``/`` trade/NN deficit/NN ''/'' figure/NN is/VBZ limited/VBN to/TO traditional/JJ merchandise/NN trade/NN :/: manufactured/VBN goods/NNS and/CC raw/JJ materials/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT quarterly/JJ balance-of-payments/NNS report/NN ,/, those/DT merchandise/NN trade/NN figures/NNS are/VBP merged/VBN with/IN statistics/NNS on/IN exports/NNS and/CC imports/NNS of/IN services/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN returns/NNS on/IN investments/NNS abroad/RB by/IN Americans/NNS and/CC returns/NNS on/IN foreign/JJ investments/NNS in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ./.
Over/IN time/NN ,/, through/IN benchmark/NN surveys/NNS ,/, the/DT corrected/VBN data/NN on/IN service/NN exports/NNS and/CC imports/NNS have/VBP been/VBN gathered/VBN ./.
The/DT first/JJ three/CD major/JJ areas/NNS of/IN the/DT service/NN sector/NN to/TO be/VB revamped/VBN were/VBD expenditures/NNS by/IN foreign/JJ students/NNS in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ./. -LRB-/-LRB- net/JJ after/IN expenditures/NNS by/IN Americans/NNS studying/VBG abroad/RB -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, some/DT exports/NNS by/IN professional/JJ firms/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- a/DT law/NN firm/NN billing/VBG a/DT German/JJ client/NN for/IN services/NNS rendered/VBN in/IN watching/VBG legislation/NN in/IN Washington/NNP is/VBZ as/RB much/JJ an/DT export/NN as/IN shipment/NN of/IN an/DT American/JJ jet/NN engine/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, and/CC improved/VBN data/NNS from/IN travel/NN and/CC tourism/NN ./.
In/IN just/RB these/DT three/CD areas/NNS ,/, the/DT Commerce/NNP Department/NNP found/VBD $/$ #/CD billion/CD more/JJR exports/NNS than/IN previously/RB reported/VBN and/CC $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD more/JJR imports/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT net/JJ result/NN that/IN the/DT U.S./NNP service/NN surplus/NN in/IN #/CD increased/VBD by/IN $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD ,/, to/TO $/$ #/CD billion/CD ./.
Combined/VBN with/IN recalculations/NNS and/CC revisions/NNS in/IN other/JJ trade/NN areas/NNS ,/, the/DT value/NN of/IN U.S./NNP net/JJ exports/NNS that/WDT had/VBD not/RB previously/RB been/VBN recorded/VBN was/VBD about/RB $/$ #/CD billion/CD a/DT year/NN ./.
That/DT means/VBZ that/IN the/DT U.S./NNP trade/NN deficit/NN was/VBD running/VBG closer/RB to/TO $/$ #/CD billion/CD than/IN to/TO $/$ #/CD billion/CD in/IN #/CD ,/, and/CC $/$ #/CD billion/CD -LRB-/-LRB- annualized/VBN -RRB-/-RRB- rather/RB than/IN $/$ #/CD billion/CD in/IN the/DT first/JJ quarter/NN of/IN #/CD ./.
These/DT revised/VBN figures/NNS also/RB may/MD explain/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT recent/JJ strength/NN of/IN the/DT dollar/NN ./.
The/DT materially/RB smaller/JJR trade/NN deficit/NN may/MD have/VB been/VBN already/RB discounted/VBN in/IN the/DT market/NN ./.
What/WP does/VBZ this/DT mean/NN for/IN trade/NN policy/NN ?/.
Too/RB early/JJ to/TO tell/VB ,/, but/CC a/DT trade/NN deficit/NN that/WDT is/VBZ significantly/RB smaller/JJR than/IN we/PRP imagined/VBD does/VBZ suggest/VB a/DT review/NN of/IN our/PRP$ trade/NN posture/NN ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ not/RB relieve/VB the/DT need/NN for/IN our/PRP$ market-opening/JJ efforts/NNS for/IN both/DT goods/NNS and/CC services/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ suggest/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ our/PRP$ exports/NNS of/IN services/NNS ,/, and/CC not/RB just/RB borrowing/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ financing/VBG our/PRP$ imports/NNS of/IN goods/NNS ./.
