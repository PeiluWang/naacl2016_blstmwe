The/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP agreed/VBD to/TO decide/VB whether/IN the/DT federal/JJ Pension/NNP Benefit/NNP Guaranty/NNP Corp./NNP may/MD require/VB LTV/NNP Corp./NNP to/TO reassume/VB funding/NN responsibility/NN for/IN a/DT $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD shortfall/NN in/IN the/DT company/NN 's/POS pension/NN plans/NNS ./.
The/DT high/JJ court/NN 's/POS decision/NN ,/, expected/VBN next/JJ spring/NN ,/, may/MD affect/VB the/DT stability/NN of/IN many/JJ large/JJ corporate/JJ pension/NN plans/NNS that/WDT have/VBP relied/VBN on/IN the/DT availability/NN of/IN pension/NN insurance/NN provided/VBN by/IN the/DT federal/JJ pension/NN regulatory/JJ and/CC insurance/NN agency/NN ./.
The/DT agency/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ funded/VBN through/IN insurance/NN premiums/NNS from/IN employers/NNS ,/, insures/VBZ pension/NN benefits/NNS for/IN some/DT #/CD million/CD private-sector/JJ workers/NNS who/WP take/VBP part/NN in/IN single-employer/JJ pension/NN plans/NNS ./.
It/PRP recently/RB reported/VBD assets/NNS of/IN $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD and/CC liabilities/NNS of/IN $/$ #/CD billion/CD ./.
In/IN its/PRP$ appeal/NN to/TO the/DT high/JJ court/NN ,/, the/DT agency/NN said/VBD the/DT federal/JJ appeals/NNS court/NN ruling/NN ,/, which/WDT favored/VBD LTV/NNP ,/, threatened/VBD to/TO transform/VB the/DT agency/NN from/IN an/DT insurer/NN of/IN troubled/VBN pension/NN plans/NNS into/IN an/DT ``/`` open-ended/JJ source/NN of/IN industry/NN bailouts/NNS ./. ''/''
The/DT ruling/NN also/RB may/MD determine/VB how/WRB quickly/RB LTV/NNP is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO complete/VB its/PRP$ Chapter/NNP #/CD reorganization/NN ./.
LTV/NNP filed/VBD for/IN protection/NN under/IN Chapter/NNP #/CD in/IN federal/JJ bankruptcy/NN court/NN in/IN #/CD ./.
The/DT filing/NN was/VBD partly/RB the/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD shortfall/NN in/IN LTV/NNP 's/POS three/CD pension/NN plans/NNS operated/VBN for/IN its/PRP$ LTV/NNP Steel/NNP Co./NNP subsidiary/NN 's/POS employees/NNS ./.
In/IN January/NNP #/CD ,/, as/IN LTV/NNP Steel/NNP continued/VBD operating/VBG while/NN under/IN reorganization/NN ,/, the/DT agency/NN terminated/VBD the/DT three/CD LTV/NNP pension/NN plans/NNS to/TO keep/VB its/PRP$ insurance/NN liability/NN from/IN increasing/VBG ./.
Termination/NN means/VBZ that/IN the/DT agency/NN 's/POS insurance/NN assumes/VBZ the/DT liabilities/NNS and/CC pays/VBZ the/DT pension/NN benefits/NNS already/RB owed/VBN under/IN the/DT plans/NNS ,/, but/CC workers/NNS do/VBP n't/RB accrue/VB new/JJ benefits/NNS ./.
A/DT few/JJ months/NNS later/RB ,/, under/IN pressure/NN from/IN the/DT United/NNP Steelworkers/NNP of/IN America/NNP ,/, LTV/NNP instituted/VBD a/DT new/JJ program/NN to/TO provide/VB retirement/NN benefits/NNS similar/JJ to/TO those/DT in/IN the/DT terminated/VBN plans/NNS ./.
Because/IN the/DT federal/JJ pension/NN agency/NN had/VBD taken/VBN over/RP the/DT old/JJ plans/NNS ,/, LTV/NNP would/MD be/VB responsible/JJ only/RB for/IN benefits/NNS paid/VBN under/IN the/DT new/JJ pension/NN plans/NNS ./.
But/CC the/DT agency/NN viewed/VBD the/DT creation/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ plans/NNS as/IN an/DT abuse/NN of/IN federal/JJ pension/NN law/NN and/CC an/DT attempt/NN to/TO transfer/VB the/DT liability/NN of/IN the/DT $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD shortfall/NN from/IN LTV/NNP to/TO federal/JJ insurance/NN ./.
The/DT agency/NN also/RB concluded/VBD that/IN LTV/NNP 's/POS financial/JJ status/NN had/VBD improved/VBN while/IN it/PRP was/VBD under/IN reorganization/NN ./.
In/IN September/NNP #/CD ,/, it/PRP ordered/VBD LTV/NNP to/TO reassume/VB liability/NN and/CC funding/VBG for/IN the/DT three/CD original/JJ plans/NNS ./.
LTV/NNP challenged/VBD the/DT order/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT federal/JJ district/NN court/NN in/IN New/NNP York/NNP in/IN June/NNP #/CD ruled/VBD that/IN the/DT agency/NN improperly/RB ordered/VBD LTV/NNP to/TO reassume/VB responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT plans/NNS ./.
In/IN May/NNP ,/, a/DT federal/JJ appeals/NNS court/NN in/IN New/NNP York/NNP agreed/VBD that/IN the/DT agency/NN acted/VBD unlawfully/RB ./.
The/DT appeals/NNS court/NN said/VBD there/EX was/VBD no/DT evidence/NN that/IN Congress/NNP intended/VBD to/TO allow/VB the/DT pension/NN agency/NN to/TO consider/VB a/DT company/NN 's/POS creation/NN of/IN new/JJ benefit/NN plans/NNS as/IN a/DT basis/NN for/IN ordering/VBG that/DT company/NN to/TO reassume/VB liability/NN for/IN old/JJ plans/NNS ./.
The/DT appeals/NNS court/NN also/RB said/VBD the/DT agency/NN had/VBD to/TO consider/VB a/DT company/NN 's/POS long-term/JJ ability/NN to/TO fund/VB pension/NN plans/NNS ,/, not/RB just/RB short-term/JJ improved/VBN financial/JJ status/NN ./.
In/IN Dallas/NNP ,/, LTV/NNP said/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD disappointed/VBN that/IN the/DT court/NN agreed/VBD to/TO hear/VB the/DT case/NN because/IN it/PRP believes/VBZ the/DT move/NN will/MD further/RBR delay/VB its/PRP$ Chapter/NNP #/CD proceedings/NNS ./.
The/DT company/NN has/VBZ n't/RB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO come/VB up/RP with/IN a/DT reorganization/NN plan/NN ,/, in/IN part/NN ,/, because/IN of/IN the/DT sizable/JJ disagreement/NN with/IN the/DT pension/NN agency/NN ./.
But/CC LTV/NNP ,/, a/DT steel/NN ,/, aerospace/NN and/CC energy/NN concern/NN ,/, said/VBD it/PRP is/VBZ confident/JJ that/IN the/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP will/MD uphold/VB the/DT lower-court/NN decisions/NNS and/CC said/VBD it/PRP expects/VBZ to/TO continue/VB discussions/NNS with/IN the/DT agency/NN about/IN a/DT settlement/NN while/IN the/DT case/NN is/VBZ being/VBG reviewed/VBN ./.
