The/DT Democratic/JJ leadership/NN agreed/VBD to/TO allow/VB a/DT floor/NN vote/NN on/IN the/DT issue/NN before/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN --/: a/DT debate/NN certain/JJ to/TO focus/VB on/IN the/DT alleged/VBN racial/JJ inequality/NN of/IN death/NN sentencing/NN ./.
Even/RB some/DT Democrats/NNS concede/VBP that/IN there/EX is/VBZ probably/RB a/DT majority/NN in/IN the/DT Senate/NNP that/WDT favors/VBZ some/DT kind/NN of/IN broad/JJ capital-punishment/NN measure/NN ./.
The/DT pending/VBG bill/NN ,/, introduced/VBN by/IN Mr./NNP Thurmond/NNP ,/, would/MD revive/VB the/DT long-dormant/JJ federal/JJ death-penalty/NN laws/NNS by/IN instituting/VBG legal/JJ procedures/NNS required/VBN by/IN the/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP ./.
In/IN #/CD ,/, the/DT high/JJ court/NN swept/VBD aside/RB all/DT capital-punishment/NN laws/NNS --/: federal/JJ and/CC state/NN alike/RB --/: as/IN unconstitutional/JJ ./.
But/CC in/IN #/CD ,/, the/DT court/NN permitted/VBD resurrection/NN of/IN such/JJ laws/NNS ,/, if/IN they/PRP meet/VBP certain/JJ procedural/JJ requirements/NNS ./.

Since/IN that/DT #/CD ruling/NN ,/, #/CD states/NNS have/VBP reintroduced/VBN the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- Separately/RB ,/, the/DT Senate/NNP last/JJ week/NN passed/VBD a/DT bill/NN permitting/VBG execution/NN of/IN terrorists/NNS who/WP kill/VBP Americans/NNS abroad/RB ./. -RRB-/-RRB-
Amid/IN the/DT swirl/NN of/IN punitive/JJ rhetoric/NN surrounding/VBG the/DT issue/NN ,/, one/CD critical/JJ question/NN involves/VBZ whether/IN a/DT federal/JJ death/NN penalty/NN ,/, on/IN top/NN of/IN existing/VBG state/NN laws/NNS ,/, would/MD deter/VB any/DT would-be/JJ criminals/NNS ./.
For/IN one/CD thing/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ unlikely/JJ that/IN many/JJ people/NNS would/MD receive/VB federal/JJ death/NN sentences/NNS ,/, let/VB alone/RB be/VB executed/VBN ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT crimes/NNS incorporated/VBN in/IN the/DT Thurmond/NNP bill/NN are/VBP exceedingly/RB rare/JJ --/: killing/VBG a/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP justice/NN ,/, for/IN instance/NN ,/, or/CC deliberately/RB causing/VBG a/DT train/NN wreck/NN that/WDT results/VBZ in/IN a/DT death/NN ./.

The/DT last/JJ federal/JJ execution/NN before/IN the/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP 's/POS #/CD ruling/NN banning/VBG the/DT death/NN penalty/NN took/VBD place/NN in/IN #/CD ,/, meaning/VBG that/IN the/DT federal/JJ government/NN did/VBD n't/RB exercise/VB its/PRP$ execution/NN authority/NN for/IN eight/CD years/NNS ./.
``/`` In/IN that/DT sense/NN ,/, the/DT whole/JJ debate/NN is/VBZ sort/NN of/IN a/DT fraud/NN ,/, ''/'' argues/VBZ a/DT Democratic/JJ Senate/NNP staff/NN member/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO resuscitating/VBG the/DT old/JJ issue/NN of/IN whether/IN death/NN sentences/NNS deter/VBP criminals/NNS ,/, this/DT bill/NN has/VBZ made/VBN race/NN a/DT major/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT death-penalty/NN debate/NN ./.
Before/IN the/DT bill/NN left/VBD committee/NN ,/, Sen./NNP Edward/NNP Kennedy/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Mass/NNP ./. -RRB-/-RRB- attached/VBD an/DT amendment/NN that/WDT would/MD allow/VB a/DT defendant/NN to/TO escape/VB from/IN a/DT death/NN sentence/NN in/IN jurisdictions/NNS shown/VBN to/TO have/VB meted/VBN out/RP executions/NNS in/IN a/DT racist/NN manner/NN ./.
The/DT amendment/NN prompted/VBD an/DT ironic/JJ protest/NN from/IN Mr./NNP Thurmond/NNP ,/, who/WP complained/VBD that/IN it/PRP would/MD ``/`` kill/VB ''/'' capital/JJ punishment/NN ./.
A/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN studies/NNS suggest/VBP that/IN state/NN judges/NNS and/CC juries/NNS have/VBP imposed/VBN the/DT penalty/NN in/IN a/DT racially/RB discriminatory/JJ fashion/NN ./.

Since/IN most/JJS prosecutors/NNS would/MD n't/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO demonstrate/VB conclusively/RB that/IN racial/JJ considerations/NNS did/VBD n't/RB affect/VB sentencing/VBG ,/, executions/NNS everywhere/RB might/MD come/VB to/TO a/DT halt/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Boyd/NNP explains/VBZ ./.
At/IN least/JJS #/CD major/JJ studies/NNS purport/VBP to/TO show/VB that/IN particular/JJ states/NNS have/VBP imposed/VBN the/DT death/NN penalty/NN disproportionately/RB against/IN killers/NNS of/IN whites/NNS compared/VBN with/IN blacks/NNS ,/, and/CC against/IN black/JJ defendants/NNS compared/VBN with/IN white/JJ defendants/NNS ./.
