The/DT Treasury/NNP Department/NNP proposed/VBD that/IN banks/NNS be/VB required/VBN to/TO keep/VB detailed/JJ records/NNS of/IN international/JJ wire/NN transfers/NNS ,/, which/WDT officials/NNS believe/VBP is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ vehicle/NN used/VBN by/IN drug/NN traffickers/NNS to/TO move/VB billions/NNS of/IN dollars/NNS in/IN and/CC out/IN of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ./.
In/IN recent/JJ testimony/NN on/IN Capitol/NNP Hill/NNP ,/, Treasury/NNP officials/NNS said/VBD they/PRP were/VBD considering/VBG the/DT new/JJ reporting/NN requirements/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT expected/VBN publication/NN of/IN the/DT proposal/NN in/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Register/NNP today/NN is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ official/JJ step/NN toward/IN creating/VBG final/JJ regulations/NNS ./.
The/DT Treasury/NNP is/VBZ still/RB working/VBG out/RP the/DT details/NNS with/IN bank/NN trade/NN associations/NNS and/CC the/DT other/JJ government/NN agencies/NNS that/WDT have/VBP a/DT hand/NN in/IN fighting/VBG money/NN laundering/NN ./.
Among/IN the/DT possibilities/NNS the/DT Treasury/NNP is/VBZ considering/VBG are/VBP requirements/NNS that/IN banks/NNS keep/VB records/NNS identifying/VBG the/DT originators/NNS and/CC recipients/NNS of/IN international/JJ wire/NN transfers/NNS ./.
Another/DT suggestion/NN would/MD draw/VB banks/NNS more/RBR directly/RB into/IN tracking/VBG down/RP money/NN launderers/NNS by/IN developing/VBG a/DT ``/`` suspicious/JJ international/JJ wire/NN transfer/NN profile/NN ,/, ''/'' which/WDT banks/NNS would/MD use/VB to/TO spotlight/VB questionable/JJ payments/NNS ./.
But/CC banks/NNS may/MD prefer/VB using/VBG a/DT profile/NN that/WDT targets/VBZ selected/VBN transactions/NNS ,/, rather/RB than/IN a/DT blanket/NN reporting/NN requirement/NN ./.
Banks/NNS now/RB are/VBP required/VBN only/RB to/TO report/VB cash/NN deposits/NNS or/CC withdrawals/NNS of/IN $/$ #,#/CD or/CC more/JJR ./.
But/CC wire/NN transfers/NNS from/IN a/DT standing/VBG account/NN --/: including/VBG those/DT bigger/JJR than/IN $/$ #,#/CD --/: are/VBP n't/RB reported/VBN ./.
Officials/NNS believe/VBP this/DT has/VBZ left/VBN a/DT gaping/JJ loophole/NN that/IN illegal/JJ drug/NN businesses/NNS are/VBP exploiting/VBG ./.
Authorities/NNS estimate/VBP that/IN revenues/NNS from/IN illegal/JJ drugs/NNS in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP total/VBP about/RB $/$ #/CD billion/CD annually/RB ./.

The/DT American/NNP Bankers/NNP Association/NNP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB any/DT comment/NN on/IN the/DT plan/NN ./.
The/DT proposal/NN now/RB enters/VBZ a/DT #-day/JJ comment/NN period/NN ,/, after/IN which/WDT the/DT Treasury/NNP will/MD propose/VB final/JJ regulations/NNS ,/, followed/VBN by/IN another/DT comment/NN period/NN ./.
