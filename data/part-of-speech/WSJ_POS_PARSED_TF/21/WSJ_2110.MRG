The/DT Commodity/NNP Futures/NNPS Trading/NNP Commission/NNP plans/VBZ to/TO restrict/VB dual/JJ trading/NN on/IN commodity/NN exchanges/NNS ,/, a/DT move/NN almost/RB certain/JJ to/TO infuriate/VB exchange/NN officials/NNS and/CC traders/NNS ./.
The/DT CFTC/NNP said/VBD it/PRP will/MD propose/VB the/DT restrictions/NNS after/IN the/DT release/NN of/IN a/DT study/NN that/WDT shows/VBZ little/JJ economic/JJ benefit/NN resulting/VBG from/IN dual/JJ trading/NN and/CC cites/VBZ ``/`` problems/NNS ''/'' associated/JJ with/IN the/DT practice/NN ./.
Dual/JJ trading/NN gives/VBZ an/DT exchange/NN trader/NN the/DT right/NN to/TO trade/VB both/DT for/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ account/NN and/CC for/IN customers/NNS ./.
The/DT issue/NN exploded/VBD this/DT year/NN after/IN a/DT Federal/NNP Bureau/NNP of/IN Investigation/NNP operation/NN led/VBD to/TO charges/NNS of/IN widespread/JJ trading/NN abuses/NNS at/IN the/DT Chicago/NNP Board/NNP of/IN Trade/NNP and/CC Chicago/NNP Mercantile/NNP Exchange/NNP ./.
While/IN not/RB specifically/RB mentioned/VBN in/IN the/DT FBI/NNP charges/NNS ,/, dual/JJ trading/NN became/VBD a/DT focus/NN of/IN attempts/NNS to/TO tighten/VB industry/NN regulations/NNS ./.
Critics/NNS contend/VBP that/IN traders/NNS were/VBD putting/VBG buying/NN or/CC selling/NN for/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ accounts/NNS ahead/RB of/IN other/JJ traders/NNS '/POS customer/NN orders/NNS ./.
Traders/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO oppose/VB such/JJ restrictions/NNS because/IN dual/JJ trading/NN provides/VBZ a/DT way/NN to/TO make/VB money/NN in/IN slower/JJR markets/NNS where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT shortage/NN of/IN customer/NN orders/NNS ./.
The/DT exchanges/NNS contend/VBP that/IN dual/JJ trading/NN improves/VBZ liquidity/NN in/IN the/DT markets/NNS because/IN traders/NNS can/MD buy/VB or/CC sell/VB even/RB when/WRB they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB a/DT customer/NN order/NN in/IN hand/NN ./.
The/DT exchanges/NNS say/VBP liquidity/NN becomes/VBZ a/DT severe/JJ problem/NN for/IN thinly/RB traded/JJ contracts/NNS such/JJ as/IN those/DT with/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN remaining/VBG before/IN expiration/NN ./.
The/DT CFTC/NNP may/MD take/VB those/DT arguments/NNS into/IN account/NN by/IN allowing/VBG exceptions/NNS to/TO its/PRP$ restrictions/NNS ./.
The/DT agency/NN did/VBD n't/RB cite/VB specific/JJ situations/NNS where/WRB dual/JJ trading/NN might/MD be/VB allowed/VBN ,/, but/CC smaller/JJR exchanges/NNS or/CC contracts/NNS that/WDT need/VBP additional/JJ liquidity/NN are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO be/VB among/IN them/PRP ./.
Wendy/NNP Gramm/NNP ,/, the/DT agency/NN 's/POS chairman/NN ,/, told/VBD the/DT Senate/NNP Agriculture/NNP Committee/NNP that/IN she/PRP expects/VBZ the/DT study/NN to/TO be/VB released/VBN within/IN two/CD weeks/NNS and/CC the/DT rule/NN changes/NNS to/TO be/VB completed/VBN by/IN Thanksgiving/NNP ./.
The/DT study/NN ,/, by/IN the/DT CFTC/NNP 's/POS division/NN of/IN economic/JJ analysis/NN ,/, shows/VBZ that/IN ``/`` a/DT trade/NN is/VBZ a/DT trade/NN ,/, ''/'' a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT study/NN team/NN said/VBD ./.
Whether/IN a/DT trade/NN is/VBZ done/VBN on/IN a/DT dual/JJ or/CC non-dual/JJ basis/NN ,/, the/DT member/NN said/VBD ,/, ``/`` does/VBZ n't/RB seem/VB to/TO have/VB much/JJ economic/JJ impact/NN ./. ''/''
Currently/RB ,/, most/JJS traders/NNS on/IN commodity/NN exchanges/NNS specialize/VBP in/IN trading/NN either/CC for/IN customer/NN accounts/NNS ,/, which/WDT makes/VBZ them/PRP brokers/NNS ,/, or/CC for/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ accounts/NNS as/IN socalled/JJ locals/NNS ./.
``/`` The/DT tests/NNS indicate/VBP that/IN dual/JJ and/CC non-dual/JJ traders/NNS are/VBP similar/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT trade/NN executions/NNS and/CC liquidity/NN they/PRP provide/VBP to/TO the/DT market/NN ,/, ''/'' Mrs./NNP Gramm/NNP told/VBD the/DT Senate/NNP panel/NN ./.
Members/NNS of/IN Congress/NNP have/VBP proposed/VBN restricting/VBG dual/JJ trading/NN in/IN bills/NNS to/TO reauthorize/VB CFTC/NNP operations/NNS ./.
The/DT House/NNP 's/POS bill/NN would/MD prohibit/VB dual/JJ trading/NN in/IN markets/NNS with/IN daily/JJ average/JJ volume/NN of/IN #,#/CD contracts/NNS or/CC more/JJR ,/, comprising/VBG those/DT considered/VBN too/RB difficult/JJ to/TO track/VB without/IN a/DT sophisticated/JJ computer/NN system/NN ./.
The/DT Senate/NNP bill/NN would/MD force/VB the/DT CFTC/NNP to/TO suspend/VB dual/JJ trading/NN if/IN an/DT exchange/NN ca/MD n't/RB show/VB that/DT its/PRP$ oversight/NN system/NN can/MD detect/VB dual-trading/NN abuses/NNS ./.
So/RB far/RB ,/, one/CD test/NN of/IN restricting/VBG dual/JJ trading/NN has/VBZ worked/VBN well/RB ./.
The/DT Chicago/NNP Merc/NNP banned/VBD dual/JJ trading/NN in/IN its/PRP$ Standard/NNP &/CC Poor/NNP 's/POS #-stock/JJ index/NN futures/NNS pit/NN in/IN #/CD ./.
Under/IN the/DT rules/NNS ,/, traders/NNS decide/VBP before/IN a/DT session/NN begins/VBZ whether/IN they/PRP will/MD trade/VB for/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ account/NN or/CC for/IN customers/NNS ./.
Traders/NNS who/WP stand/VBP on/IN the/DT pit/NN 's/POS top/NN step/NN ,/, where/WRB most/JJS customer/NN orders/NNS are/VBP executed/VBN ,/, ca/MD n't/RB trade/VB for/IN themselves/PRP ./.
A/DT Merc/NNP spokesman/NN said/VBD the/DT plan/NN has/VBZ n't/RB made/VBD much/JJ difference/NN in/IN liquidity/NN in/IN the/DT pit/NN ./.
``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ too/RB soon/RB to/TO tell/VB .../: but/CC people/NNS do/VBP n't/RB seem/VB to/TO be/VB unhappy/JJ with/IN it/PRP ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.
He/PRP said/VBD he/PRP would/MD n't/RB comment/VB on/IN the/DT CFTC/NNP plan/NN until/IN the/DT exchange/NN has/VBZ seen/VBN the/DT full/JJ proposal/NN ./.
But/CC at/IN a/DT meeting/NN last/JJ week/NN ,/, Tom/NNP Donovan/NNP ,/, the/DT Board/NNP of/IN Trade/NNP 's/POS president/NN ,/, told/VBD commodity/NN lawyers/NNS :/: ``/`` Dual/JJ trading/NN is/VBZ definitely/RB worth/JJ saving/NN ./.
It/PRP adds/VBZ something/NN to/TO the/DT market/NN ./.
