CHICAGO/NNP -/: Options/NNS traders/NNS were/VBD among/IN the/DT big/JJ victims/NNS of/IN Friday/NNP 's/POS plunging/VBG stock/NN market/NN ,/, including/VBG one/CD small/JJ firm/NN that/WDT required/VBD an/DT emergency/NN $/$ #/CD million/CD bailout/NN ./.
While/IN Monday/NNP 's/POS rebounding/VBG markets/NNS helped/VBD other/JJ investors/NNS recoup/VB losses/NNS ,/, many/JJ options/NNS customers/NNS and/CC professional/JJ traders/NNS in/IN stock-index/NN options/NNS and/CC the/DT options/NNS on/IN takeover/NN stocks/NNS were/VBD left/VBN with/IN multimillion-dollar/JJ losses/NNS ,/, traders/NNS here/RB and/CC in/IN New/NNP York/NNP said/VBD ./.
Options/NNS traders/NNS were/VBD hurt/VBN worse/RBR than/IN others/NNS on/IN Friday/NNP because/IN of/IN the/DT highly/RB volatile/JJ nature/NN of/IN options/NNS ,/, which/WDT often/RB rise/VBP or/CC fall/VBP in/IN value/NN several/JJ times/NNS the/DT amount/NN of/IN the/DT price/NN change/NN in/IN the/DT individual/JJ stock/NN or/CC index/NN of/IN stocks/NNS on/IN which/WDT they/PRP are/VBP based/VBN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, options/NNS traders/NNS Friday/NNP were/VBD stuck/VBN with/IN losses/NNS that/WDT also/RB were/VBD several/JJ times/NNS larger/JJR than/IN those/DT suffered/VBN by/IN many/JJ stock/NN traders/NNS in/IN New/NNP York/NNP ./.
Jeffrey/NNP Miller/NNP of/IN Miller/NNP Tabak/NNP Hirsch/NNP &/CC Co./NNP said/VBD that/IN given/VBN the/DT high/JJ degree/NN of/IN leverage/NN in/IN the/DT options/NNS market/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ ``/`` very/RB easy/RB for/IN these/DT guys/NNS to/TO get/VB wiped/VBN out/RP ./.
That/DT may/MD just/RB be/VB the/DT nature/NN of/IN these/DT highly/RB leveraged/JJ little/JJ creatures/NNS ./. ''/''
An/DT options/NNS contract/NN gives/VBZ the/DT holder/NN the/DT right/NN to/TO buy/VB -LRB-/-LRB- call/VB -RRB-/-RRB- or/CC sell/VB -LRB-/-LRB- put/VB -RRB-/-RRB- a/DT specific/JJ amount/NN of/IN stock/NN ,/, or/CC in/IN this/DT case/NN the/DT value/NN of/IN a/DT stock/NN index/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN a/DT predetermined/VBN price/NN within/IN a/DT given/VBN time/NN period/NN ./.
Options/NNS traders/NNS who/WP ,/, in/IN return/NN for/IN a/DT small/JJ fee/NN ,/, or/CC premium/NN ,/, had/VBD previously/RB sold/VBN put/JJ options/NNS on/IN stocks/NNS or/CC stock/NN indexes/NNS were/VBD forced/VBN on/IN Friday/NNP to/TO buy/VB those/DT contracts/NNS back/RP at/IN the/DT previously/RB agreed/VBN prices/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD substantially/RB above/IN those/DT in/IN the/DT market/NN as/IN it/PRP was/VBD falling/VBG ./.
They/PRP then/RB had/VBD no/DT choice/NN in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS but/CC to/TO sell/VB the/DT contracts/NNS at/IN prevailing/VBG prices/NNS --/: in/IN most/JJS cases/NNS at/IN a/DT substantial/JJ loss/NN ./.
The/DT latest/JJS round/NN of/IN losses/NNS is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB a/DT serious/JJ blow/NN to/TO the/DT Chicago/NNP Board/NNP Options/NNPS Exchange/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ never/RB fully/RB recovered/VBN from/IN the/DT aftershock/NN of/IN Black/NNP Monday/NNP ,/, when/WRB investors/NNS fled/VBD the/DT market/NN because/IN of/IN huge/JJ losses/NNS ./.
Making/VBG matters/NNS worse/RBR was/VBD the/DT fact/NN that/IN late/JJ Friday/NNP afternoon/NN the/DT CBOE/NNP halted/VBD stock-index/NN options/NNS trading/NN in/IN step/NN with/IN the/DT Chicago/NNP Mercantile/NNP Exchange/NNP 's/POS halt/NN in/IN stock-index/NN futures/NNS ./.
But/CC while/IN the/DT Merc/NNP reopened/VBD a/DT half/NN hour/NN later/RB ,/, the/DT CBOE/NNP remained/VBD closed/JJ ,/, leaving/VBG many/JJ options/NNS traders/NNS unable/JJ to/TO make/VB trades/NNS that/WDT might/MD have/VB reduced/VBN the/DT losses/NNS ./.
CBOE/NNP Chairman/NNP Alger/NNP ``/`` Duke/NNP ''/'' Chapman/NN ,/, said/VBD that/IN ,/, unlike/IN the/DT futures/NNS market/NN ,/, the/DT options/NNS exchange/NN has/VBZ to/TO open/VB in/IN a/DT rotation/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ each/DT different/JJ options/NNS series/NN to/TO trade/NN ./.

Fossett/NNP still/RB had/VBD several/JJ million/CD dollars/NNS in/IN capital/NN left/VBN after/IN Friday/NNP 's/POS close/NN of/IN trading/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB enough/RB that/IN regulators/NNS ,/, worried/VBN about/IN another/DT potential/JJ market/NN plunge/NN yesterday/NN ,/, would/MD let/VB it/PRP reopen/VB for/IN trading/NN ,/, options/NNS exchange/NN officials/NNS said/VBD ./.
