A/DT federal/JJ appeals/NNS court/NN struck/VBD down/RP a/DT natural-gas/NN regulation/NN that/WDT had/VBD prevented/VBN pipeline/NN companies/NNS from/IN passing/VBG to/TO customers/NNS part/NN of/IN $/$ #/CD billion/CD in/IN costs/NNS from/IN controversial/JJ ``/`` take-or-pay/JJ ''/'' contracts/NNS ./.
The/DT court/NN ,/, in/IN a/DT #-#/CD ruling/NN ,/, threw/VBD out/RP a/DT deadline/NN set/VBN by/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Energy/NNP Regulatory/NNP Commission/NNP for/IN settling/VBG old/JJ contract/NN disputes/NNS over/IN gas/NN that/IN the/DT pipeline/NN companies/NNS reserved/VBN but/CC did/VBD n't/RB use/VB ./.
FERC/NNP 's/POS regulation/NN had/VBD given/VBN pipelines/NNS until/IN March/NNP #/CD ,/, #/CD ,/, to/TO pass/VB on/RP to/TO customers/NNS as/RB much/RB as/IN #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT costs/NNS of/IN buying/VBG out/RP their/PRP$ broken/JJ contracts/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD made/VBN with/IN producers/NNS when/WRB gas/NN prices/NNS were/VBD high/JJ and/CC supplies/NNS short/JJ ./.
A/DT majority/NN of/IN old/JJ contracts/NNS were/VBD renegotiated/VBN by/IN the/DT deadline/NN and/CC settled/VBD at/IN steep/JJ discounts/NNS ./.
But/CC pipeline/NN companies/NNS estimate/VBP they/PRP still/RB face/VBP $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD in/IN liabilities/NNS from/IN unresolved/JJ disputes/NNS ,/, including/VBG $/$ #/CD billion/CD they/PRP fear/VBP they/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO pass/VB on/RP to/TO customers/NNS ./.
According/VBG to/TO industry/NN lawyers/NNS ,/, the/DT ruling/NN gives/VBZ pipeline/NN companies/NNS an/DT important/JJ second/JJ chance/NN to/TO resolve/VB remaining/VBG disputes/NNS and/CC take/VB advantage/NN of/IN the/DT cost-sharing/NN mechanism/NN ./.
The/DT court/NN left/VBD open/RP whether/IN FERC/NNP could/MD reimpose/VB a/DT new/JJ deadline/NN later/RB ./.
The/DT court/NN ,/, agreeing/VBG with/IN pipeline/NN companies/NNS ,/, found/VBD the/DT March/NNP #/CD deadline/NN was/VBD ``/`` arbitrary/JJ and/CC capricious/JJ ''/'' and/CC ``/`` highly/RB prejudicial/JJ to/TO the/DT bargaining/NN power/NN of/IN pipelines/NNS ''/'' that/WDT were/VBD forced/VBN to/TO negotiate/VB settlement/NN of/IN the/DT old/JJ take-or-pay/JJ contracts/NNS to/TO meet/VB the/DT deadline/NN ./.
A/DT report/NN last/JJ month/NN by/IN the/DT Interstate/NNP Natural/NNP Gas/NNP Association/NNP of/IN America/NNP found/VBD that/IN pipelines/NNS '/POS settlement/NN costs/NNS had/VBD jumped/VBN in/IN the/DT three/CD months/NNS before/IN the/DT deadline/NN to/TO #/CD cents/NNS on/IN the/DT dollar/NN ,/, from/IN #/CD cents/NNS on/IN the/DT dollar/NN in/IN #/CD ./.
The/DT court/NN ordered/VBD FERC/NNP to/TO justify/VB within/IN #/CD days/NNS not/RB only/RB its/PRP$ cost-sharing/NN deadline/NN ,/, but/CC other/JJ major/JJ elements/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ proposed/VBN regulation/NN for/IN introducing/VBG more/JJR competition/NN into/IN natural-gas/NN transportation/NN ./.
The/DT court/NN also/RB questioned/VBD a/DT crediting/NN mechanism/NN that/WDT could/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO resolve/VB take-or-pay/JJ liabilities/NNS ./.
The/DT complex/JJ regulation/NN ,/, known/VBN in/IN the/DT industry/NN as/IN Order/NN #/CD ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN hotly/RB contested/JJ by/IN all/DT sides/NNS ,/, including/VBG natural-gas/NN producers/NNS ,/, pipelines/NNS ,/, local/JJ distribution/NN companies/NNS and/CC consumers/NNS ./.
The/DT court/NN 's/POS decision/NN would/MD allow/VB FERC/NNP to/TO change/VB some/DT of/IN its/PRP$ provisions/NNS ,/, but/CC ensures/VBZ it/PRP will/MD be/VB reviewed/VBN again/RB quickly/RB by/IN the/DT court/NN ./.
