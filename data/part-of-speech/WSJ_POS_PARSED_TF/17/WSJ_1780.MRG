The/DT House/NNP Public/NNP Works/NNP and/CC Transportation/NNP Committee/NNP approved/VBD a/DT bill/NN that/WDT would/MD give/VB the/DT Transportation/NNP Department/NNP power/NN to/TO block/VB airline/NN leveraged/JJ buy-outs/NNS ,/, despite/IN a/DT clear/JJ veto/NN threat/NN from/IN the/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN ./.
The/DT #-#/CD vote/NN clears/VBZ the/DT way/NN for/IN consideration/NN on/IN the/DT House/NNP floor/NN next/IN week/NN or/CC the/DT week/NN after/IN ./.
Transportation/NNP Secretary/NNP Samuel/NNP Skinner/NNP ,/, in/IN a/DT letter/NN to/TO the/DT committee/NN ,/, warned/VBD that/IN he/PRP would/MD urge/VB President/NNP Bush/NNP to/TO veto/VB the/DT legislation/NN if/IN it/PRP passed/VBD Congress/NNP ./.
The/DT Senate/NNP Commerce/NNP Committee/NNP already/RB has/VBZ approved/VBN similar/JJ legislation/NN ./.
On/IN Monday/NNP ,/, a/DT letter/NN from/IN Mr./NNP Skinner/NNP 's/POS deputy/NN ,/, Elaine/NNP Chao/NNP ,/, said/VBD the/DT administration/NN opposed/VBD the/DT legislation/NN ``/`` in/IN its/PRP$ present/JJ form/NN ./. ''/''
Some/DT of/IN the/DT bill/NN 's/POS supporters/NNS had/VBD taken/VBN heart/NN from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT letter/NN was/VBD n't/RB signed/VBN by/IN Mr./NNP Skinner/NNP and/CC that/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB contain/VB a/DT veto/NN threat/NN ./.
The/DT stepped-up/JJ administration/NN warnings/NNS annoyed/VBD some/DT lawmakers/NNS ,/, especially/RB senior/JJ Republicans/NNPS who/WP supported/VBD the/DT bill/NN because/IN they/PRP thought/VBD the/DT Transportation/NNP Department/NNP favored/VBD it/PRP ./.
``/`` We/PRP backed/VBD this/DT bill/NN because/IN we/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP would/MD help/VB Skinner/NNP ,/, ''/'' one/CD Republican/NNP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` and/CC now/RB we/PRP 're/VBP out/IN there/RB dangling/VBG in/IN the/DT wind/NN ./. ''/''
A/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS ago/IN ,/, Mr./NNP Skinner/NNP testified/VBD before/IN Congress/NNP that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB ``/`` cleaner/JJR ,/, more/RBR efficient/JJ ''/'' if/IN he/PRP had/VBD authority/NN to/TO block/VB buy-outs/NNS in/IN advance/NN ./.
But/CC he/PRP never/RB took/VBD an/DT official/JJ position/NN on/IN the/DT bill/NN and/CC has/VBZ steadfastly/RB maintained/VBN that/IN he/PRP already/RB has/VBZ enough/JJ authority/NN to/TO deal/VB with/IN buy-outs/NNS ./.
Under/IN the/DT committee/NN bill/NN ,/, the/DT Transportation/NN secretary/NN would/MD have/VB #/CD days/NNS ,/, and/CC an/DT additional/JJ #/CD days/NNS if/IN needed/VBN ,/, to/TO review/VB any/DT proposed/VBN purchase/NN of/IN #/CD %/NN or/CC more/JJR of/IN a/DT major/JJ U.S./NNP airline/NN 's/POS voting/NN stock/NN ./.
The/DT secretary/NN would/MD be/VB required/VBN to/TO block/VB an/DT acquisition/NN if/IN he/PRP concluded/VBD that/IN it/PRP would/MD so/RB weaken/VB an/DT airline/NN financially/RB that/IN it/PRP would/MD hurt/VB safety/NN or/CC reduce/VB the/DT carrier/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO compete/VB ,/, or/CC if/IN it/PRP gave/VBD control/NN to/TO a/DT foreign/JJ interest/NN ./.
Although/IN the/DT legislation/NN would/MD apply/VB to/TO any/DT acquisition/NN of/IN a/DT major/JJ airline/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ aimed/VBN at/IN transactions/NNS financed/VBN by/IN large/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN debt/NN ./.
Supporters/NNS of/IN the/DT bill/NN are/VBP concerned/VBN an/DT airline/NN might/MD sacrifice/VB costly/JJ safety/NN measures/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO repay/VB debt/NN ./.
The/DT panel/NN 's/POS action/NN occurs/VBZ in/IN a/DT politically/RB charged/VBN atmosphere/NN surrounding/VBG recent/JJ buy-out/NN proposals/NNS ,/, their/PRP$ apparent/JJ collapse/NN and/CC the/DT volatile/JJ conditions/NNS in/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN ./.
``/`` It/PRP became/VBD apparent/JJ in/IN hearings/NNS that/IN there/EX ought/MD to/TO be/VB regulation/NN of/IN leveraged/JJ buy-outs/NNS of/IN some/DT sort/NN ,/, ''/'' Rep./NNP James/NNP Oberstar/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Minn./NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, chairman/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP Aviation/NNP Subcommittee/NNP ,/, said/VBD during/IN the/DT panel/NN 's/POS deliberations/NNS ./.
``/`` I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB believe/VB in/IN the/DT airline/NN business/NN you/PRP can/MD be/VB totally/RB laissez-faire/FW because/IN of/IN the/DT high/JJ degree/NN of/IN public/JJ interest/NN ''/'' at/IN stake/NN ./.
But/CC Mr./NNP Skinner/NNP disagreed/VBD ,/, calling/VBG the/DT legislation/NN ``/`` a/DT retreat/NN from/IN the/DT policy/NN of/IN deregulaton/NN of/IN the/DT airline/NN industry/NN ./. ''/''
In/IN his/PRP$ letter/NN to/TO Committee/NNP Chairman/NNP Glenn/NNP Anderson/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Calif./NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, the/DT secretary/NN also/RB said/VBD the/DT bill/NN ``/`` would/MD be/VB at/IN odds/NNS with/IN the/DT administration/NN 's/POS policies/NNS welcoming/VBG open/JJ foreign/JJ investment/NN and/CC market/NN allocation/NN of/IN resources/NNS ./. ''/''
Currently/RB ,/, the/DT Transportation/NNP Department/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB the/DT authority/NN to/TO block/VB a/DT takeover/NN in/IN advance/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, if/IN the/DT secretary/NN concludes/VBZ that/IN a/DT transaction/NN has/VBZ made/VBN a/DT carrier/NN unfit/NN to/TO operate/VB ,/, the/DT department/NN may/MD revoke/VB its/PRP$ certificate/NN ,/, grounding/VBG the/DT airline/NN ./.
Such/JJ authority/NN is/VBZ more/JJR than/IN adequate/JJ ,/, say/VBP opponents/NNS of/IN the/DT legislation/NN ./.
But/CC supporters/NNS argue/VBP that/IN grounding/VBG an/DT airline/NN is/VBZ so/RB drastic/JJ that/IN the/DT department/NN would/MD hesitate/VB doing/VBG it/PRP ./.
The/DT panel/NN rejected/VBD a/DT proposal/NN pushed/VBN by/IN AMR/NNP Corp./NNP ,/, the/DT parent/NN of/IN American/NNP Airlines/NNPS ,/, to/TO allow/VB the/DT Transportation/NN secretary/NN to/TO block/VB corporate/JJ raiders/NNS from/IN waging/VBG proxy/NN fights/NNS to/TO oust/VB boards/NNS that/WDT oppose/VBP a/DT leveraged/JJ buy-out/NN ./.
It/PRP also/RB voted/VBD down/RP proposals/NNS to/TO give/VB the/DT secretary/NN much/RB more/JJR discretion/NN on/IN whether/IN to/TO block/VB a/DT buy-out/NN and/CC to/TO require/VB the/DT department/NN to/TO consider/VB the/DT impact/NN of/IN a/DT buy-out/NN on/IN workers/NNS ./.
