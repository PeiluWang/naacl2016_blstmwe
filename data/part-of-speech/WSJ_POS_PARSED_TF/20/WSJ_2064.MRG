Conservatives/NNS have/VBP an/DT important/JJ decision/NN to/TO make/VB this/DT fall/NN ./.
At/IN the/DT recent/JJ meetings/NNS of/IN the/DT World/NNP Bank/NNP and/CC International/NNP Monetary/NNP Fund/NNP ,/, the/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN announced/VBD its/PRP$ intention/NN to/TO decide/VB by/IN yearend/NN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT next/JJ increase/NN in/IN the/DT IMF/NNP 's/POS capital/NN base/NN ./.
While/IN the/DT U.S./NNP share/NN of/IN the/DT increase/NN probably/RB will/MD not/RB reach/VB the/DT $/$ #/CD billion/CD or/CC more/RBR implicit/JJ in/IN the/DT IMF/NNP 's/POS request/NN for/IN a/DT doubling/NN of/IN its/PRP$ $/$ #/CD billion/CD capital/NN ,/, the/DT administration/NN probably/RB will/MD agree/VB to/TO a/DT multibillion-dollar/JJ increase/NN ./.
This/DT would/MD be/VB consistent/JJ with/IN its/PRP$ unwavering/VBG support/NN for/IN the/DT Brady/NNP Plan/NNP and/CC G-#/NNP exchange-rate/JJ intervention/NN ,/, and/CC with/IN its/PRP$ financial/JJ commitment/NN to/TO Mexico/NNP ,/, Poland/NNP and/CC others/NNS ./.
The/DT IMF/NNP has/VBZ several/JJ reasons/NNS for/IN requesting/VBG the/DT increase/NN ./.
Its/PRP$ role/NN in/IN the/DT economies/NNS of/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS has/VBZ grown/VBN steadily/RB since/IN the/DT #s/CD ./.
The/DT size/NN and/CC pace/NN of/IN disbursements/NNS will/MD accelerate/VB further/RB under/IN the/DT Brady/NNP Plan/NNP ,/, which/WDT promises/VBZ larger/JJR and/CC earlier/JJR disbursements/NNS to/TO approved/VBN countries/NNS ./.
At/IN least/JJS three/CD other/JJ factors/NNS have/VBP encouraged/VBN the/DT IMF/NNP to/TO insist/VB on/IN increased/VBN capital/NN ./.
First/JJ ,/, it/PRP argues/VBZ that/IN its/PRP$ capital/NN base/NN must/MD be/VB increased/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO maintain/VB its/PRP$ size/NN relative/JJ to/TO world/NN financial/JJ markets/NNS ,/, for/IN which/WDT it/PRP feels/VBZ some/DT responsibility/NN ./.
Second/JJ ,/, the/DT World/NNP Bank/NNP 's/POS recent/JJ $/$ #/CD billion/CD capital/NN increase/NN --/: $/$ #/CD billion/CD from/IN the/DT U.S./NNP --/: has/VBZ left/VBN the/DT IMF/NNP feeling/VBG less/JJR than/IN first/JJ fiddle/NN among/IN international/JJ financial/JJ institutions/NNS ./.
Third/JJ ,/, the/DT IMF/NNP would/MD like/VB to/TO meet/VB Japan/NNP 's/POS request/NN for/IN increased/VBN ownership/NN -LRB-/-LRB- currently/RB #.#/CD %/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
Japan/NNP has/VBZ supported/VBN a/DT larger/JJR role/NN for/IN the/DT IMF/NNP in/IN developing-country/JJ debt/NN issues/NNS ,/, and/CC is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ financial/JJ resource/NN for/IN IMF-guided/JJ programs/NNS in/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS ./.
While/IN international/JJ politics/NNS may/MD argue/VB for/IN the/DT capital/NN increase/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ economic/JJ case/NN against/IN it/PRP ./.
Opponents/NNS of/IN the/DT increase/NN argue/VBP that/IN the/DT IMF/NNP practices/NNS central/JJ planning/NN while/IN supporting/VBG ineffective/JJ governments/NNS ./.
They/PRP question/VBP whether/IN the/DT IMF/NNP has/VBZ any/DT role/NN in/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS ,/, given/VBN its/PRP$ original/JJ mandate/NN to/TO assist/VB industrial/JJ countries/NNS in/IN balance-of-payments/NNS emergencies/NNS ./.
Opponents/NNS show/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP already/RB more/JJR funds/NNS available/JJ than/IN commendable/JJ reform/NN efforts/NNS ./.
They/PRP worry/VBP that/DT new/JJ IMF/NNP funding/NN of/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS will/MD simply/RB end/VB up/RP substituting/VBG IMF/NNP debt/NN for/IN reschedulable/JJ commercial/JJ bank/NN debt/NN ,/, a/DT bad/JJ trade/NN all/DT around/IN ./.
They/PRP believe/VBP microeconomics/NNS ,/, which/WDT addresses/VBZ the/DT problems/NNS of/IN markets/NNS ,/, investment/NN climate/NN and/CC management/NN practices/NNS ,/, is/VBZ the/DT key/NN to/TO developing-country/JJ growth/NN ,/, not/RB the/DT IMF/NNP 's/POS Keynesian/JJ focus/NN on/IN trade/NN deficits/NNS ,/, quarterly/JJ targets/NNS and/CC government/NN debt/NN ./.
They/PRP point/VBP at/IN the/DT numerous/JJ developing-country/JJ governments/NNS that/WDT have/VBP inflated/VBN ,/, taxed/VBN and/CC regulated/VBN themselves/PRP into/IN despair/NN under/IN successive/JJ IMF/NNP programs/NNS ./.
Decisions/NNS on/IN increases/NNS in/IN the/DT IMF/NNP 's/POS capital/NN base/NN traditionally/RB are/VBP made/VBN by/IN the/DT administration/NN ,/, with/IN subsequent/JJ authorization/NN by/IN Congress/NNP ./.
The/DT last/JJ U.S./NNP congressional/JJ authorization/NN ,/, in/IN #/CD ,/, was/VBD a/DT political/JJ donnybrook/NN and/CC carried/VBD a/DT $/$ #/CD billion/CD housing/NN program/NN along/IN with/IN it/PRP to/TO secure/VB adequate/JJ votes/NNS ./.
The/DT politics/NNS of/IN the/DT #/CD congressional/JJ authorization/NN are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO be/VB similar/JJ to/TO those/DT of/IN previous/JJ authorizations/NNS ./.
Liberals/NNS may/MD support/VB the/DT stabilizing/VBG ,/, quasi-governmental/JJ role/NN of/IN the/DT IMF/NNP on/IN two/CD conditions/NNS :/: that/IN the/DT administration/NN give/VBP assurances/NNS that/IN liberal/JJ Democrats/NNPS '/POS support/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB used/VBN against/IN them/PRP in/IN congressional/JJ re-election/NN campaigns/NNS ;/: and/CC that/IN the/DT legislation/NN address/NN --/: with/IN dollars/NNS --/: social/JJ and/CC environmental/JJ concerns/NNS ./.
Conservative/NNP Republicans/NNPS will/MD be/VB given/VBN the/DT choice/NN of/IN supporting/VBG or/CC fighting/VBG their/PRP$ party/NN 's/POS popular/JJ president/NN in/IN an/DT election/NN year/NN ./.
A/DT U.S./NNP decision/NN to/TO refuse/VB the/DT IMF/NNP its/PRP$ capital/NN increase/NN ,/, or/CC limit/VB it/PRP to/TO #/CD %/NN ,/, would/MD bring/VB a/DT major/JJ change/NN in/IN international/JJ economic/JJ policy/NN ,/, and/CC could/MD not/RB be/VB taken/VBN lightly/RB ./.
Commentators/NNS would/MD fret/VB over/IN the/DT implications/NNS for/IN the/DT G-#/NN coordination/NN process/NN and/CC the/DT stability/NN of/IN world/NN financial/JJ markets/NNS ./.
Because/IN commercial/JJ banks/NNS and/CC the/DT developing-country/JJ governments/NNS believe/VBP they/PRP will/MD get/VB a/DT piece/NN of/IN any/DT capital/NN increase/NN ,/, a/DT scaled-down/JJ IMF/NNP mission/NN would/MD leave/VB both/DT feeling/VBG shortchanged/VBN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, a/DT U.S./NNP rejection/NN of/IN the/DT capital/NN increase/NN -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC transfer/NN of/IN shares/NNS to/TO Japan/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- would/MD give/VB Japan/NNP an/DT argument/NN against/IN future/JJ calls/NNS for/IN economic/JJ burden-sharing/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, a/DT decision/NN to/TO increase/VB the/DT IMF/NNP 's/POS capital/NN would/MD reinforce/VB the/DT central/JJ economic/JJ role/NN of/IN multilateral/JJ institutions/NNS in/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS ./.
With/IN the/DT increase/NN ,/, even/RB more/RBR developing-country/JJ energy/NN and/CC talent/NN would/MD be/VB diverted/VBN from/IN creating/VBG profitable/JJ economic/JJ systems/NNS to/TO setting/NN up/RP economic/JJ planning/VBG ministries/NNS that/WDT generate/VBP IMF-approved/JJ economic/JJ plans/NNS ./.
Upping/VBG the/DT ante/NN could/MD slow/VB economic/JJ development/NN even/RB further/RB ,/, as/IN countries/NNS delay/VBP market-opening/JJ steps/NNS in/IN anticipation/NN of/IN richer/JJR multilateral/JJ support/NN ./.
Conservatives/NNS should/MD take/VB a/DT position/NN prior/RB to/TO the/DT administration/NN 's/POS year-end/JJ deadline/NN ./.
The/DT issues/NNS are/VBP too/RB important/JJ to/TO be/VB left/VBN to/TO the/DT financial/JJ and/CC budget/NN ministries/NNS fighting/VBG over/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT capital/NN increase/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN its/PRP$ purpose/NN ./.
If/IN conservatives/NNS do/VBP n't/RB support/VB an/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT IMF/NNP 's/POS capital/NN ,/, then/RB it/PRP is/VBZ incumbent/JJ on/IN them/PRP to/TO speak/VB up/RP now/RB and/CC explain/VB the/DT alternative/NN ./.
