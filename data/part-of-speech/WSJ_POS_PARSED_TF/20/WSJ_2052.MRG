In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT regime/NN has/VBZ established/VBN well-paid/JJ paramilitary/JJ forces/NNS totaling/VBG more/RBR than/IN #,#/CD ,/, including/VBG #,#/CD Soviet-trained/JJ troops/NNS of/IN the/DT Interior/NNP Ministry/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- KHAD$$WAD/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT still/RB is/VBZ directed/VBN by/IN #,#/CD Soviet/NNP KGB/NNP officers/NNS ./.

Before/IN his/PRP$ assassination/NN in/IN #/CD ,/, President/NNP Zia/NNP of/IN Pakistan/NNP repeatedly/RB stated/VBD that/IN fresh/JJ Soviet/JJ troops/NNS were/VBD being/VBG inserted/VBN into/IN Afghanistan/NNP even/RB as/IN others/NNS were/VBD ostentatiously/RB withdrawn/VBN ./.

They/PRP took/VBD more/RBR than/IN #/CD %/NN casualties/NNS ;/: journalists/NNS report/VBP that/IN they/PRP faced/VBD minefields/NNS without/IN mine/NN detectors/NNS ./.
