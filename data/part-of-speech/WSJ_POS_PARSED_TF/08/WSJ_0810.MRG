Cie./NNP de/NNP Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP Chairman/NNP Marc/NNP Fournier/NNP said/VBD his/PRP$ board/NN unanimously/RB rejected/VBD as/IN too/RB low/JJ the/DT $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD bid/NN by/IN Cie./NNP Financiere/NNP de/NNP Paribas/NNP to/TO bring/VB its/PRP$ stake/NN in/IN Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP to/TO #.#/CD %/NN ./.
At/IN a/DT news/NN conference/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Fournier/NNP accused/VBD Paribas/NNP of/IN planning/VBG to/TO pay/VB for/IN the/DT takeover/NN by/IN selling/VBG parts/NNS of/IN the/DT company/NN ,/, whose/WP$ interests/NNS include/VBP insurance/NN ,/, banking/NN ,/, tuna/NN canning/NN ,/, sugar/NN and/CC orange/NN juice/NN ./.
The/DT chairman/NN said/VBD his/PRP$ board/NN members/NNS ,/, including/VBG representatives/NNS of/IN West/JJ German/JJ insurance/NN giant/NN Allianz/NNP AG/NNP and/CC French/JJ banks/NNS Credit/NNP Lyonnais/NNP and/CC Societe/NNP Generale/NNP ,/, hold/VBP nearly/RB #/CD %/NN of/IN Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP 's/POS capital/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Fournier/NNP said/VBD that/IN as/IN Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP chairman/NN ,/, he/PRP is/VBZ prohibited/VBN by/IN takeover/NN regulations/NNS from/IN organizing/VBG his/PRP$ own/JJ defense/NN or/CC doing/VBG anything/NN besides/IN managing/VBG current/JJ company/NN business/NN ./.
But/CC sources/NNS said/VBD he/PRP will/MD be/VB urging/VBG his/PRP$ allies/NNS to/TO boost/VB their/PRP$ stakes/NNS in/IN Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ being/VBG traded/VBN in/IN London/NNP and/CC is/VBZ to/TO resume/VB trading/VBG in/IN Paris/NNP Tuesday/NNP ./.
At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, he/PRP is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO seek/VB legal/JJ and/CC regulatory/JJ means/NNS of/IN blocking/VBG or/CC delaying/VBG Paribas/NNP 's/POS bid/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, the/DT sources/NNS said/VBD ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ decided/VBN against/IN seeking/VBG a/DT white/JJ knight/NN or/CC organizing/VBG a/DT counterbid/NN for/IN Paribas/NNP ./.
Mr./NNP Fournier/NNP said/VBD Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP 's/POS #/CD unconsolidated/JJ ,/, or/CC parent-company/NN ,/, profit/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB #.#/CD billion/CD francs/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- $/$ #.#/CD million/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, up/RB from/IN #.#/CD million/CD francs/NNS last/JJ year/NN ./.
That/DT is/VBZ due/RB mostly/RB to/TO payments/NNS from/IN Allianz/NNP for/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT #/CD %/NN stake/NN it/PRP has/VBZ agreed/VBN to/TO acquire/VB in/IN Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP 's/POS insurance/NN business/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Fournier/NNP said/VBD the/DT exceptional/JJ gain/NN would/MD mean/VB nearly/RB twice/RB as/RB high/JJ a/DT dividend/NN this/DT year/NN as/IN last/JJ ./.
If/IN holders/NNS avoid/VBP tendering/VBG to/TO Paribas/NNP ,/, he/PRP added/VBD ,/, they/PRP can/MD expect/VB strong/JJ dividends/NNS again/RB next/JJ year/NN ./.
Analysts/NNS noted/VBD that/IN over/IN the/DT past/JJ #/CD years/NNS ,/, Mr./NNP Fournier/NNP has/VBZ built/VBN his/PRP$ company/NN through/IN astute/JJ stock-market/NN activity/NN and/CC has/VBZ warded/VBN off/RP at/IN least/JJS three/CD takeover/NN attempts/NNS ./.
This/DT time/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, some/DT analysts/NNS think/VBP he/PRP could/MD face/VB a/DT real/JJ battle/NN ./.
``/`` Without/IN some/DT unexpected/JJ ``/`` coup/FW de/FW theatre/FW ''/'' ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB see/VB what/WP will/MD block/VB the/DT Paribas/NNP bid/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Philippe/NNP de/NNP Cholet/NNP ,/, analyst/NN at/IN the/DT brokerage/NN Cholet-Dupont/NNP &/CC Cie/NNP ./.
Mr./NNP de/NNP Cholet/NNP said/VBD Mr./NNP Fournier/NNP 's/POS biggest/JJS hope/NN was/VBD to/TO somehow/RB persuade/VB regulatory/JJ authorities/NNS to/TO block/VB the/DT bid/NN ./.
Paribas/NNP still/RB needs/VBZ the/DT go-ahead/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/FW des/FW Operations/FW de/FW Bourse/FW ,/, a/DT government/NN regulatory/JJ agency/NN ,/, but/CC analysts/NNS said/VBD that/DT is/VBZ considered/VBN likely/RB ./.
Mr./NNP Fournier/NNP also/RB noted/VBD that/IN Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP joined/VBD Paribas/NNP 's/POS core/NN of/IN shareholders/NNS when/WRB Paribas/NNP was/VBD denationalized/VBN in/IN #/CD ,/, and/CC said/VBD it/PRP now/RB holds/VBZ just/RB under/IN #/CD %/NN of/IN Paribas/NNP 's/POS shares/NNS ./.
Once/RB he/PRP realized/VBD that/IN Paribas/NNP 's/POS intentions/NNS were/VBD n't/RB friendly/JJ ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, but/CC before/IN the/DT bid/NN was/VBD launched/VBN ,/, he/PRP sought/VBD approval/NN to/TO boost/VB his/PRP$ Paribas/NNP stake/NN above/IN #/CD %/NN ./.
The/DT petition/NN is/VBZ still/RB pending/JJ ,/, but/CC Mr./NNP Fournier/NNP downplayed/VBD the/DT likelihood/NN of/IN his/PRP$ organizing/VBG a/DT takeover/NN bid/NN of/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ for/IN the/DT much-larger/JJ Paribas/NNP ./.
One/CD big/JJ question/NN now/RB is/VBZ the/DT likely/JJ role/NN of/IN Mr./NNP Fournier/NNP 's/POS allies/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Fournier/NNP said/VBD the/DT large/JJ institutions/NNS that/WDT hold/VBP nearly/RB #/CD %/NN of/IN Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP 's/POS capital/NN all/RB strongly/RB support/VB him/PRP ,/, but/CC some/DT analysts/NNS said/VBD they/PRP are/VBP n't/RB so/RB sure/JJ ./.
Allianz/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, has/VBZ said/VBD in/IN official/JJ comments/NNS so/RB far/RB that/IN it/PRP will/MD remain/VB neutral/JJ ./.
Paribas/NNP is/VBZ Allianz/NNP 's/POS lead/JJ French/JJ bank/NN ./.
Paribas/NNP said/VBD Monday/NNP that/IN it/PRP intends/VBZ to/TO bid/VB to/TO boost/VB its/PRP$ stake/NN in/IN Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP to/TO #.#/CD %/NN ,/, from/IN the/DT #.#/CD %/NN it/PRP already/RB owns/VBZ ./.
The/DT purchase/NN of/IN the/DT additional/JJ #/CD %/NN stake/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO cost/VB more/JJR than/IN #/CD billion/CD francs/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
Paribas/NNP says/VBZ it/PRP will/MD offer/VB #,#/CD francs/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- $/$ #.#/CD -RRB-/-RRB- each/DT for/IN Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP shares/NNS that/WDT enjoy/VBP full/JJ dividend/NN rights/NNS ,/, and/CC #,#/CD francs/NNS each/DT for/IN a/DT block/NN of/IN shares/NNS issued/VBN July/NNP #/CD ,/, which/WDT will/MD receive/VB only/RB partial/JJ dividends/NNS this/DT year/NN ./.
Alternatively/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO offer/VB three/CD Paribas/NNP shares/NNS for/IN one/CD Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP share/NN ./.
The/DT Paribas/NNP offer/NN values/VBZ Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP at/IN about/RB #/CD billion/CD francs/NNS ,/, depending/VBG on/IN how/WRB many/JJ of/IN Navigation/NNP Mixte/NNP 's/POS warrants/NNS are/VBP converted/VBN into/IN shares/NNS during/IN the/DT takeover/NN battle/NN ./.
