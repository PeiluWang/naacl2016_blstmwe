Senate/NNP Democrats/NNS favoring/VBG a/DT cut/NN in/IN the/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN have/VBP decided/VBN ,/, under/IN pressure/NN from/IN their/PRP$ leaders/NNS ,/, not/RB to/TO offer/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ proposal/NN ,/, placing/VBG another/DT obstacle/NN in/IN the/DT path/NN of/IN President/NNP Bush/NNP 's/POS legislative/JJ priority/NN ./.
A/DT core/NN group/NN of/IN six/CD or/CC so/RB Democratic/JJ senators/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN working/VBG behind/IN the/DT scenes/NNS to/TO develop/VB a/DT proposal/NN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT tax/NN on/IN the/DT gain/NN from/IN the/DT sale/NN of/IN assets/NNS ./.
The/DT plan/NN was/VBD complete/JJ except/IN for/IN finishing/VBG touches/NNS ,/, and/CC there/EX was/VBD talk/NN that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB unveiled/VBN as/RB early/RB as/IN yesterday/NN ./.
But/CC Senate/NNP Majority/NNP Leader/NNP George/NNP Mitchell/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Maine/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, a/DT vigorous/JJ opponent/NN of/IN the/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN cut/NN ,/, called/VBD the/DT group/NN to/TO meet/VB with/IN him/PRP Wednesday/NNP night/NN and/CC again/RB yesterday/NN ./.
Sen./NNP Mitchell/NNP urged/VBD them/PRP to/TO desist/VB ./.
Afterward/RB ,/, leaders/NNS of/IN the/DT dissident/JJ Democrats/NNS relented/VBD ,/, and/CC said/VBD they/PRP would/MD n't/RB offer/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ proposal/NN as/IN they/PRP had/VBD planned/VBN ./.
The/DT decision/NN is/VBZ a/DT setback/NN for/IN President/NNP Bush/NNP ,/, who/WP needs/VBZ the/DT support/NN of/IN Democrats/NNS to/TO pass/VB the/DT tax/NN cut/NN through/IN the/DT Democratic-controlled/JJ Senate/NNP ./.
Having/VBG a/DT proposal/NN sponsored/VBN by/IN Democrats/NNS would/MD have/VB given/VBN the/DT president/NN an/DT advantage/NN ./.
Having/VBG only/RB a/DT Republican/JJ measure/NN makes/VBZ the/DT task/NN harder/RBR ./.
Still/RB ,/, Sen./NNP Bob/NNP Packwood/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- R./NNP ,/, Ore./NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, the/DT lead/JJ sponsor/NN of/IN the/DT Republican/JJ capital-gains/NNS amendment/NN ,/, predicted/VBD that/IN the/DT tax/NN cut/NN would/MD be/VB enacted/VBN this/DT year/NN ./.
He/PRP said/VBD a/DT clear/JJ majority/NN of/IN senators/NNS back/VBP the/DT tax/NN reduction/NN and/CC that/IN ultimately/RB there/EX would/MD be/VB enough/JJ senators/NNS to/TO overcome/VB any/DT procedural/JJ hurdle/NN the/DT Democratic/JJ leadership/NN might/MD erect/VB ./.
But/CC Sen./NNP Mitchell/NNP ,/, buoyed/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ victory/NN among/IN fellow/JJ Democrats/NNS ,/, strongly/RB disagreed/VBD ./.
Mr./NNP Mitchell/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN predicting/VBG that/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS initiative/NN would/MD fail/VB this/DT year/NN ./.
Yesterday/NN ,/, in/IN an/DT interview/NN ,/, he/PRP added/VBD that/IN the/DT Democrats/NNS '/POS decision/NN ``/`` increases/VBZ the/DT likelihood/NN that/IN a/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN cut/NN will/MD not/RB pass/VB this/DT year/NN ./. ''/''
Mr./NNP Mitchell/NNP 's/POS first/JJ victory/NN came/VBD last/JJ week/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT Senate/NNP passed/VBD a/DT deficit-reduction/JJ bill/NN that/WDT did/VBD n't/RB contain/VB a/DT capital-gains/NNS provision/NN ./.
That/DT vote/NN made/VBD it/PRP unlikely/JJ that/IN a/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN cut/NN would/MD be/VB included/VBN in/IN the/DT final/JJ bill/NN ,/, now/RB being/VBG drafted/VBN by/IN House/NNP and/CC Senate/NNP negotiators/NNS ./.
The/DT House/NNP version/NN of/IN the/DT bill/NN does/VBZ include/VB the/DT tax/NN cut/NN ./.
Now/RB Republican/JJ leaders/NNS are/VBP concentrating/VBG on/IN attaching/VBG a/DT capital-gains/NNS amendment/NN to/TO some/DT other/JJ bill/NN ,/, perhaps/RB a/DT measure/NN raising/VBG the/DT federal/JJ borrowing/NN limit/NN or/CC a/DT second/JJ tax/NN bill/NN that/WDT would/MD follow/VB on/IN the/DT heels/NNS of/IN the/DT deficit-reduction/JJ legislation/NN ./.
To/TO help/VB lay/VB the/DT groundwork/NN for/IN that/DT fight/NN ,/, President/NNP Bush/NNP plans/VBZ early/JJ next/JJ week/NN to/TO meet/VB at/IN the/DT White/NNP House/NNP with/IN some/DT #/CD Democratic/JJ senators/NNS who/WP favor/VBP cutting/VBG the/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN or/CC are/VBP undecided/JJ on/IN the/DT issue/NN ./.
The/DT president/NN apparently/RB will/MD have/VB only/RB one/CD bill/NN to/TO push/VB ,/, Sen./NNP Packwood/NNP 's/POS ,/, and/CC at/IN least/JJS some/DT of/IN the/DT dissident/JJ Democrats/NNS plan/VBP to/TO support/VB it/PRP ./.
``/`` I/PRP may/MD want/VB to/TO offer/VB additional/JJ amendments/NNS to/TO improve/VB it/PRP when/WRB the/DT bill/NN comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT floor/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Sen./NNP David/NNP Boren/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Okla./NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, a/DT leader/NN of/IN those/DT Democrats/NNS ./.
The/DT Packwood/NNP plan/NN ,/, as/IN expected/VBN ,/, would/MD allow/VB individuals/NNS to/TO exclude/VB from/IN income/NN #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT gain/NN from/IN the/DT sale/NN of/IN a/DT capital/NN asset/NN held/VBN for/IN more/JJR than/IN one/CD year/NN ./.
The/DT exclusion/NN would/MD rise/VB five/CD percentage/NN points/NNS for/IN each/DT year/NN the/DT asset/NN was/VBD held/VBN ,/, until/IN it/PRP reached/VBD a/DT maximum/NN of/IN #/CD %/NN after/IN seven/CD years/NNS ./.
The/DT exclusion/NN would/MD apply/VB to/TO assets/NNS sold/VBN after/IN Oct./NNP #/CD ./.
As/IN an/DT alternative/NN ,/, taxpayers/NNS could/MD chose/VBD to/TO reduce/VB their/PRP$ gains/NNS by/IN an/DT inflation/NN index/NN ./.
For/IN corporations/NNS ,/, the/DT top/JJ tax/NN rate/NN on/IN the/DT sale/NN of/IN assets/NNS held/VBN for/IN more/JJR than/IN three/CD years/NNS would/MD be/VB cut/VBN to/TO #/CD %/NN from/IN the/DT current/JJ top/NN rate/NN of/IN #/CD %/NN ./.
That/DT rate/NN would/MD gradually/RB decline/VB to/TO as/RB little/JJ as/IN #/CD %/NN for/IN corporate/JJ assets/NNS held/VBN for/IN #/CD years/NNS ./.
The/DT Packwood/NNP plan/NN also/RB would/MD include/VB a/DT proposal/NN ,/, designed/VBN by/IN Sen./NNP William/NNP Roth/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- R./NNP ,/, Del./NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, that/WDT would/MD create/VB new/JJ tax/NN benefits/NNS for/IN individual/JJ retirement/NN accounts/NNS ./.
The/DT Roth/NNP plan/NN would/MD create/VB a/DT new/JJ ,/, non-deductible/JJ IRA/NNP from/IN which/WDT money/NN could/MD be/VB withdrawn/VBN tax-free/JJ not/RB only/JJ for/IN retirement/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB for/IN the/DT purchase/NN of/IN a/DT first/JJ home/NN ,/, education/NN expenses/NNS and/CC medical/JJ expenses/NNS ./.
Current/JJ IRAs/NNS could/MD be/VB rolled/VBN over/RP into/IN the/DT new/JJ IRAs/NNS ,/, but/CC would/MD be/VB subject/JJ to/TO tax/NN though/IN no/DT penalty/NN ./.
