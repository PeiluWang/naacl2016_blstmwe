Tuesday/NNP 's/POS rout/NN of/IN a/DT GOP/NNP congressional/JJ hopeful/NN in/IN a/DT Mississippi/NNP district/NN that/DT has/VBZ n't/RB backed/VBD a/DT Democratic/JJ presidential/JJ candidate/NN since/IN Adlai/NNP Stevenson/NNP is/VBZ another/DT reminder/NN that/IN ,/, at/IN least/JJS at/IN the/DT federal/JJ level/NN ,/, political/JJ ``/`` ticket/NN splitting/NN ''/'' has/VBZ been/VBN on/IN the/DT rise/NN over/IN the/DT past/JJ half/JJ century/NN ./.
In/IN only/RB one/CD presidential/JJ election/NN year/NN prior/RB to/TO #/CD did/VBD more/JJR than/IN #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT nation/NN 's/POS congressional/JJ districts/NNS choose/VB a/DT different/JJ party/NN 's/POS candidate/NN for/IN the/DT White/NNP House/NNP than/IN for/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Representatives/NNP ./.
Now/RB that/DT percentage/NN routinely/RB equals/VBZ a/DT third/JJ and/CC twice/RB has/VBZ been/VBN above/IN #/CD %/NN ./.
As/IN we/PRP know/VBP ,/, voters/NNS tend/VBP to/TO favor/VB Republicans/NNS more/RBR in/IN races/NNS for/IN president/NN than/IN in/IN those/DT for/IN Congress/NNP ./.
In/IN every/DT presidential/JJ election/NN over/IN the/DT past/JJ half/JJ century/NN ,/, except/IN for/IN the/DT Goldwater/NNP presidential/JJ candidacy/NN ,/, the/DT GOP/NNP has/VBZ captured/VBN a/DT greater/JJR percentage/NN of/IN the/DT major-party/JJ popular/JJ vote/NN for/IN president/NN than/IN it/PRP has/VBZ of/IN congressional/JJ seats/NNS or/CC the/DT popular/JJ vote/NN for/IN Congress/NNP ./.
Prior/RB to/TO #/CD ,/, the/DT pattern/NN was/VBD nearly/RB the/DT opposite/NN ./.
What/WP accounts/VBZ for/IN the/DT results/NNS of/IN recent/JJ decades/NNS ?/.
A/DT simple/JJ economic/JJ theory/NN may/MD provide/VB at/IN least/JJS a/DT partial/JJ explanation/NN for/IN the/DT split/JJ personality/NN displayed/VBN by/IN Americans/NNS in/IN the/DT voting/NN booth/NN ./.
The/DT theory/NN relies/VBZ on/IN three/CD assumptions/NNS :/:
#/LS -RRB-/-RRB- Voters/NNS can/MD ``/`` buy/VB ''/'' one/CD of/IN two/CD brands/NNS when/WRB they/PRP select/VBP their/PRP$ political/JJ agents/NNS --/: a/DT Republican/JJ brand/NN that/WDT believes/VBZ in/IN the/DT minimalist/JJ state/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT virtues/NNS of/IN private/JJ markets/NNS over/IN the/DT vices/NNS of/IN public/JJ action/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT Democratic/JJ brand/NN that/WDT believes/VBZ in/IN big/JJ government/NN and/CC in/IN public/JJ intervention/NN to/TO remedy/VB the/DT excesses/NNS attendant/JJ to/TO the/DT pursuit/NN of/IN private/JJ interest/NN ./.
#/LS -RRB-/-RRB- Congressional/JJ representatives/NNS have/VBP two/CD basic/JJ responsibilities/NNS while/IN voting/VBG in/IN office/NN --/: dealing/VBG with/IN national/JJ issues/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- programmatic/JJ actions/NNS such/JJ as/IN casting/VBG roll/NN call/NN votes/NNS on/IN legislation/NN that/WDT imposes/VBZ costs/NNS and$$or/CC confers/VBZ benefits/NNS on/IN the/DT population/NN at/IN large/JJ -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC attending/VBG to/TO local/JJ issues/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- constituency/NN service/NN and/CC pork/NN barrel/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
#/LS -RRB-/-RRB- Republican/JJ congressional/JJ representatives/NNS ,/, because/IN of/IN their/PRP$ belief/NN in/IN a/DT minimalist/JJ state/NN ,/, are/VBP less/RBR willing/JJ to/TO engage/VB in/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN than/IN are/VBP Democratic/JJ members/NNS of/IN Congress/NNP ./.
If/IN these/DT assumptions/NNS hold/VBP ,/, voters/NNS in/IN races/NNS for/IN Congress/NNP face/VBP what/WP in/IN economic/JJ theory/NN is/VBZ called/VBN a/DT prisoner/NN 's/POS dilemma/NN and/CC have/VBP an/DT incentive/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT margin/NN ,/, to/TO lean/VB Democratic/JJ ./.
If/IN they/PRP put/VBP a/DT Republican/NNP into/IN office/NN ,/, not/RB only/RB will/MD they/PRP acquire/VB less/JJR in/IN terms/NNS of/IN local/JJ benefits/NNS but/CC their/PRP$ selected/VBN legislator/NN will/MD be/VB relatively/RB powerless/JJ to/TO prevent/VB other/JJ legislators/NNS from/IN ``/`` bringing/VBG home/NN the/DT bacon/NN ''/'' to/TO their/PRP$ respective/JJ constituencies/NNS ./.
Each/DT legislator/NN ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, is/VBZ only/RB one/CD out/IN of/IN #/CD when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO national/JJ policy/NN making/NN ./.
In/IN races/NNS for/IN the/DT White/NNP House/NNP ,/, a/DT voter/NN 's/POS incentive/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT margin/NN ,/, is/VBZ to/TO lean/VB Republican/NNP ./.
Although/IN a/DT GOP/NNP president/NN may/MD limit/VB local/JJ benefits/NNS to/TO the/DT voter/NN 's/POS particular/JJ district$$state/NN ,/, such/JJ a/DT president/NN is/VBZ also/RB likely/JJ to/TO be/VB more/RBR effective/JJ at/IN preventing/VBG other/JJ districts$$states/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ legislators/NNS from/IN bringing/VBG home/NN the/DT local/JJ benefits/NNS ./.
The/DT individual/JJ voter/NN 's/VBZ standing/NN consequently/RB will/MD be/VB enhanced/VBN through/IN lower/JJR taxes/NNS ./.
While/IN this/DT theory/NN is/VBZ exceedingly/RB simple/JJ ,/, it/PRP appears/VBZ to/TO explain/VB several/JJ things/NNS ./.
First/JJ ,/, why/WRB ticket/NN splitting/NN has/VBZ increased/VBN and/CC taken/VBN the/DT peculiar/JJ pattern/NN that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ over/IN the/DT past/JJ half/JJ century/NN :/: Prior/RB to/TO the/DT election/NN of/IN Franklin/NNP Roosevelt/NNP as/IN president/NN and/CC the/DT advent/NN of/IN the/DT New/NNP Deal/NNP ,/, government/NN occupied/VBD a/DT much/RB smaller/JJR role/NN in/IN society/NN and/CC the/DT prisoner/NN 's/POS dilemma/NN problem/NN confronting/VBG voters/NNS in/IN races/NNS for/IN Congress/NNP was/VBD considerably/RB less/RBR severe/JJ ./.
Second/JJ ,/, it/PRP explains/VBZ why/WRB voters/NNS hold/VBP Congress/NNP in/IN disdain/NN but/CC generally/RB love/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ congressional/JJ representatives/NNS :/: Any/DT individual/JJ legislator/NN 's/POS constituents/NNS appreciate/VBP the/DT specific/JJ benefits/NNS that/IN the/DT legislator/NN wins/VBZ for/IN them/PRP but/CC not/RB the/DT overall/JJ cost/NN associated/VBN with/IN every/DT other/JJ legislator/NN doing/VBG likewise/RB for/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ constituency/NN ./.
Third/JJ ,/, the/DT theory/NN suggests/VBZ why/WRB legislators/NNS who/WP pay/VBP too/RB much/JJ attention/NN to/TO national/JJ policy/NN making/NN relative/JJ to/TO local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN have/VBP lower/JJR security/NN in/IN office/NN ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, first-term/JJ members/NNS of/IN the/DT House/NN ,/, once/RB the/DT most/RBS vulnerable/JJ of/IN incumbents/NNS ,/, have/VBP become/VBN virtually/RB immune/JJ to/TO defeat/VB ./.
The/DT one/CD exception/NN to/TO this/DT recent/JJ trend/NN was/VBD the/DT defeat/NN of/IN #/CD of/IN the/DT #/CD freshman/NN Republicans/NNS brought/VBD into/IN office/NN in/IN #/CD by/IN the/DT Reagan/NNP revolution/NN and/CC running/VBG for/IN re-election/NN in/IN #/CD ./.
Because/IN these/DT freshmen/NNS placed/VBD far/RB more/JJR emphasis/NN on/IN their/PRP$ partisan/JJ role/NN --/: spreading/VBG the/DT Reagan/NNP revolution/NN --/: in/IN national/JJ policy/NN making/VBG ,/, they/PRP were/VBD more/RBR vulnerable/JJ to/TO defeat/VB ./.
Fourth/JJ ,/, the/DT theory/NN indicates/VBZ why/WRB the/DT Republican/NNP Party/NNP may/MD have/VB a/DT difficult/JJ time/NN attracting/VBG viable/JJ candidates/NNS for/IN congressional/JJ office/NN ./.
Potential/JJ candidates/NNS may/MD be/VB discouraged/VBN from/IN running/VBG less/RBR by/IN the/DT congressional/JJ salary/NN than/IN by/IN the/DT prospect/NN of/IN defeat/NN at/IN the/DT hands/NNS of/IN a/DT Democratic/JJ opponent/NN ./.
To/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN potential/JJ Republican/NNP candidates/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ financial/JJ backers/NNS realize/VBP that/IN the/DT congressional/JJ prisoner/NN 's/POS dilemma/NN game/NN works/VBZ to/TO their/PRP$ disadvantage/NN ,/, the/DT Republican/NNP Party/NNP will/MD be/VB hindered/VBN in/IN its/PRP$ attempts/NNS to/TO field/VB a/DT competitive/JJ slate/NN of/IN congressional/JJ candidates/NNS ./.
Fifth/JJ ,/, the/DT theory/NN may/MD provide/VB at/IN least/JJS a/DT partial/JJ reason/NN for/IN why/WRB ticket/NN splitting/NN has/VBZ been/VBN particularly/RB pronounced/VBN in/IN the/DT South/NNP ./.
To/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN Democratic/JJ legislators/NNS from/IN the/DT South/NNP have/VBP held/VBN a/DT disproportionate/JJ share/NN of/IN power/NN in/IN Congress/NNP since/IN #/CD and/CC have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO translate/VB such/JJ clout/NN into/IN relatively/RB more/JJR local/JJ benefits/NNS for/IN their/PRP$ respective/JJ constituencies/NNS ,/, voters/NNS in/IN the/DT South/NNP have/VBP had/VBD an/DT especially/RB strong/JJ incentive/NN to/TO keep/VB such/JJ Democrats/NNS in/IN office/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, the/DT theory/NN suggests/VBZ why/WRB Republicans/NNS generally/RB have/VBP fared/VBN better/RBR in/IN Senate/NNP races/NNS than/IN in/IN campaigns/NNS for/IN the/DT House/NNP ./.
Since/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN matters/VBZ more/RBR and/CC national/JJ policy/NN making/NN matters/VBZ less/RBR in/IN the/DT lower/JJR chamber/NN of/IN Congress/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT pattern/NN one/PRP would/MD expect/VB if/IN Republicans/NNS are/VBP less/RBR willing/JJ to/TO engage/VB in/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN than/IN their/PRP$ Democratic/JJ counterparts/NNS ./.
Is/VBZ there/EX any/DT empirical/JJ support/NN for/IN this/DT theory/NN ?/.
Three/CD pieces/NNS of/IN evidence/NN corroborate/VBP the/DT key/JJ assumption/NN that/IN Democratic/JJ legislators/NNS are/VBP more/RBR willing/JJ to/TO engage/VB in/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN than/IN their/PRP$ Republican/JJ colleagues/NNS ./.
First/JJ ,/, economists/NNS James/NNP Bennett/NNP and/CC Thomas/NNP DiLorenzo/NNP find/VBP that/IN GOP/NNP senators/NNS turn/VBP back/RP roughly/RB #/CD %/NN more/JJR of/IN their/PRP$ allocated/VBN personal/JJ staff/NN budgets/NNS than/IN Democrats/NNS do/VBP ./.
To/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN the/DT primary/JJ duty/NN of/IN personal/JJ staff/NN involves/VBZ local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN ,/, this/DT indicates/VBZ that/IN political/JJ philosophy/NN leads/VBZ congressional/JJ Republicans/NNS to/TO pay/VB less/JJR attention/NN to/TO narrow/JJ constituent/NN concerns/NNS ./.
Second/JJ ,/, if/IN the/DT key/JJ assumption/NN is/VBZ valid/JJ ,/, Democrats/NNS should/MD have/VB lower/JJR attendance/NN rates/NNS on/IN roll-call/NN votes/NNS than/IN Republicans/NNS do/VBP to/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN such/JJ votes/NNS reflect/VBP national/JJ policy/NN making/NN and/CC that/IN participating/VBG in/IN such/JJ votes/NNS takes/VBZ away/RP from/IN the/DT time/NN a/DT legislator/NN could/MD otherwise/RB devote/VB to/TO local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ indeed/RB what/WP the/DT data/NNS indicate/VBP ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP ./.
The/DT Democratic/JJ House/NNP attendance/NN rate/NN has/VBZ not/RB exceeded/VBN the/DT Republican/JJ House/NNP attendance/NN rate/NN since/IN #/CD ./.
Finally/RB ,/, as/IN shown/VBN in/IN the/DT table/NN ,/, Democrats/NNS allocate/VBP a/DT higher/JJR proportion/NN of/IN their/PRP$ personal/JJ staffs/NNS to/TO district/NN offices/NNS --/: where/WRB local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN duties/NNS matter/VBP more/RBR and/CC national/JJ policy/NN making/NN activities/NNS matter/VBP less/RBR relative/JJ to/TO Washington/NNP offices/NNS ./.
An/DT examination/NN of/IN changes/NNS in/IN personal/JJ staffing/NN decisions/NNS in/IN the/DT Senate/NNP between/IN #/CD and/CC #/CD -LRB-/-LRB- when/WRB control/NN of/IN that/DT body/NN changed/VBD party/NN hands/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, moreover/RB ,/, reveals/VBZ that/IN the/DT personal/JJ staffing/NN differences/NNS noted/VBN in/IN the/DT table/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB attributed/VBN to/TO the/DT disproportionate/JJ control/NN Democrats/NNS exercise/VBP ,/, due/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ majority-party/JJ status/NN ,/, over/IN other/JJ resources/NNS such/JJ as/IN committee/NN staff/NN ./.
An/DT additional/JJ piece/NN of/IN evidence/NN from/IN the/DT Senate/NNP :/: Holding/VBG other/JJ factors/NNS constant/JJ ,/, such/JJ as/IN incumbency/NN advantages/NNS and/CC regional/JJ factors/NNS ,/, the/DT difference/NN between/IN popular/JJ votes/NNS for/IN Republican/JJ presidential/JJ and/CC senatorial/JJ candidates/NNS in/IN states/NNS conducting/VBG a/DT Senate/NNP election/NN turns/VBZ out/RP to/TO be/VB a/DT positive/JJ function/NN of/IN how/WRB onerous/JJ the/DT federal/JJ government/NN 's/POS tax/NN burden/NN is/VBZ per/IN state/NN -LRB-/-LRB- a/DT progressive/JJ tax/NN rate/NN hits/VBZ higher-income/JJ states/NNS harder/RBR -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
Put/VB more/RBR simply/JJ ,/, GOP/NNP candidates/NNS for/IN president/NN are/VBP looked/VBN on/IN more/RBR kindly/RB by/IN voters/NNS than/IN Republican/JJ candidates/NNS for/IN the/DT Senate/NNP when/WRB the/DT prisoner/NN 's/POS dilemma/NN is/VBZ more/RBR severe/JJ ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, ticket/NN splitting/NN appears/VBZ to/TO take/VB the/DT same/JJ peculiar/JJ pattern/NN at/IN the/DT state/NN government/NN level/NN as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ at/IN the/DT federal/JJ level/NN ./.
State/NN government/NN is/VBZ more/RBR typically/RB split/VBN along/IN Republican-governor$$Democratic-legislature/JJ lines/NNS than/IN the/DT reverse/NN ./.
A/DT cross-state/JJ econometric/JJ investigation/NN ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, reveals/VBZ that/IN ,/, holding/VBG other/JJ factors/NNS constant/JJ ,/, the/DT difference/NN between/IN a/DT state/NN 's/POS major-party/JJ vote/NN going/VBG to/TO the/DT Republican/JJ gubernatorial/JJ candidate/NN and/CC the/DT Republican/JJ share/NN of/IN the/DT lower/JJR state/NN house/NN is/VBZ a/DT positive/JJ function/NN of/IN the/DT state/NN tax/NN rate/NN ./.
In/IN sum/NN ,/, at/IN both/DT the/DT federal/JJ and/CC state/NN government/NN levels/NNS at/IN least/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT seemingly/RB irrational/JJ behavior/NN voters/NNS display/VBP in/IN the/DT voting/NN booth/NN may/MD have/VB an/DT exceedingly/RB rational/JJ explanation/NN ./.
