British/NNP Airways/NNP PLC/NNP ,/, a/DT crucial/JJ participant/NN in/IN the/DT proposed/VBN buy-out/NN of/IN UAL/NNP Corp./NNP ,/, washed/VBD its/PRP$ hands/NNS of/IN the/DT current/JJ efforts/NNS to/TO revive/VB a/DT bid/NN for/IN the/DT parent/NN of/IN United/NNP Airlines/NNP ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, the/DT British/JJ carrier/NN said/VBD it/PRP currently/RB has/VBZ no/DT plans/NNS to/TO participate/VB in/IN any/DT new/JJ offer/NN for/IN UAL/NNP ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, British/NNP Air/NNP officially/RB withdrew/VBD its/PRP$ support/NN for/IN the/DT previous/JJ $/$ #-a-share/JJ bid/NN in/IN a/DT terse/JJ statement/NN that/WDT said/VBD ``/`` the/DT original/JJ deal/NN is/VBZ closed/VBN ./. ''/''
Company/NN officials/NNS said/VBD later/RBR that/IN British/NNP Airways/NNP believes/VBZ its/PRP$ involvement/NN in/IN the/DT UAL/NNP buy-out/NN ended/VBD last/JJ Friday/NNP when/WRB the/DT buy-out/NN group/NN ,/, which/WDT also/RB includes/VBZ UAL/NNP 's/POS management/NN and/CC pilot/NN union/NN ,/, failed/VBD to/TO obtain/VB financing/NN for/IN the/DT $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD transaction/NN ./.
The/DT carrier/NN stopped/VBD short/RB of/IN saying/VBG it/PRP would/MD n't/RB at/IN some/DT point/NN reconsider/VB participating/VBG in/IN any/DT new/JJ bid/NN for/IN UAL/NNP ./.
However/RB ,/, company/NN officials/NNS said/VBD they/PRP plan/VBP to/TO take/VB ``/`` no/DT initiatives/NNS ''/'' to/TO resurrect/VB the/DT transaction/NN ,/, and/CC ``/`` are/VBP n't/RB aware/JJ ''/'' of/IN any/DT restructured/VBN bid/NN in/IN the/DT making/NN ./.
Collectively/RB ,/, the/DT statements/NNS raised/VBD questions/NNS about/IN whether/IN a/DT new/JJ bid/NN for/IN UAL/NNP will/MD ever/RB get/VB off/IN the/DT ground/NN ./.
The/DT transaction/NN has/VBZ had/VBD a/DT series/NN of/IN setbacks/NNS since/IN the/DT financing/VBG problems/NNS became/VBD known/VBN last/JJ Friday/NNP ,/, with/IN no/DT signs/NNS or/CC statements/NNS from/IN the/DT buy-out/JJ group/NN to/TO indicate/VB that/IN any/DT progress/NN has/VBZ taken/VBN place/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, in/IN response/NN to/TO the/DT British/NNP Air/NNP decision/NN ,/, United/VBN 's/POS pilot/NN union/NN vowed/VBD to/TO continue/VB efforts/NNS to/TO revive/VB the/DT buy-out/NN ./.
Pilot/NN union/NN Chairman/NNP Frederick/NNP C./NNP Dubinsky/NNP said/VBD advisers/NNS to/TO UAL/NNP management/NN and/CC the/DT union/NN will/MD begin/VB meeting/VBG in/IN New/NNP York/NNP today/NN and/CC will/MD work/VB through/IN the/DT weekend/NN to/TO devise/VB a/DT new/JJ proposal/NN to/TO present/VB to/TO UAL/NNP 's/POS board/NN ``/`` at/IN the/DT earliest/JJS time/NN possible/JJ ./.

Pilot/NN union/NN advisers/NNS appeared/VBD confident/JJ that/IN a/DT new/JJ bid/NN could/MD go/VB forward/RB even/RB without/IN British/NNP Air/NNP 's/POS participation/NN ./.
UAL/NNP declined/VBD to/TO comment/VB on/IN British/NNP Air/NNP 's/POS statement/NN ./.
UAL/NNP Chairman/NNP Stephen/NNP M./NNP Wolf/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ leading/VBG the/DT management/NN end/NN of/IN the/DT buy-out/NN ,/, has/VBZ n't/RB provided/VBN investors/NNS with/IN any/DT assurances/NNS about/IN the/DT prospect/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ deal/NN ./.
In/IN another/DT setback/NN yesterday/NN ,/, United/VBN 's/POS machinist/NN union/NN asked/VBD the/DT Treasury/NNP Department/NNP to/TO investigate/VB whether/IN certain/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT original/JJ buy-out/NN proposal/NN violated/VBD tax/NN laws/NNS ./.
In/IN an/DT effort/NN to/TO derail/VB the/DT buy-out/NN ,/, the/DT union/NN has/VBZ already/RB called/VBN for/IN investigations/NNS by/IN the/DT Securities/NNP and/CC Exchange/NNP Commission/NNP ,/, Transportation/NNP Department/NNP and/CC Labor/NNP Department/NNP ./.
But/CC there/EX was/VBD one/CD bright/JJ spot/NN yesterday/NN ./.
The/DT United/NNP flight-attendants/NNS union/NN agreed/VBD to/TO negotiations/NNS that/WDT could/MD lead/VB to/TO the/DT flight/NN attendants/NNS contributing/VBG concessions/NNS to/TO a/DT revived/VBN bid/NN in/IN exchange/NN for/IN an/DT ownership/NN stake/NN ./.
The/DT pilot/NN union/NN ,/, the/DT only/JJ one/CD to/TO support/VB the/DT buy-out/NN thus/RB far/RB ,/, said/VBD the/DT flight/NN attendants/NNS '/POS decision/NN ``/`` enforces/VBZ our/PRP$ belief/NN that/IN an/DT all-employee/JJ owned/VBN airline/NN is/VBZ practical/JJ and/CC achievable/JJ ./. ''/''
Still/RB ,/, without/IN the/DT assurance/NN of/IN British/NNP Airways/NNP '/POS financial/JJ backing/NN ,/, it/PRP will/MD be/VB tougher/JJR for/IN the/DT buy-out/NN group/NN to/TO convince/VB already-reluctant/JJ banks/NNS to/TO make/VB loan/NN commitments/NNS for/IN a/DT revised/VBN bid/NN ,/, especially/RB since/IN British/NNP Air/NNP 's/POS original/JJ investment/NN represented/VBN #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT cash/NN equity/NN contribution/NN for/IN the/DT bid/NN ./.
Under/IN the/DT previous/JJ plan/NN ,/, British/NNP Air/NNP would/MD have/VB received/VBN a/DT #/CD %/NN stake/NN in/IN UAL/NNP in/IN exchange/NN for/IN a/DT $/$ #/CD million/CD equity/NN investment/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT #/CD %/NN stake/NN going/VBG to/TO UAL/NNP employees/NNS and/CC #/CD %/NN to/TO UAL/NNP management/NN ./.
British/NNP Air/NNP officials/NNS said/VBD the/DT airline/NN 's/POS chairman/NN ,/, Lord/NNP King/NNP ,/, was/VBD concerned/VBN about/IN news/NN reports/NNS indicating/VBG that/IN British/NNP Air/NNP might/MD be/VB willing/JJ to/TO participate/VB in/IN a/DT bid/NN that/WDT included/VBD a/DT lower/JJR purchase/NN price/NN and/CC better/JJR investment/NN terms/NNS for/IN the/DT British/JJ carrier/NN ./.
The/DT previous/JJ reports/NNS were/VBD based/VBN on/IN remarks/NNS by/IN British/NNP Air/NNP 's/POS chief/JJ financial/JJ officer/NN ,/, Derek/NNP Stevens/NNP ,/, who/WP said/VBD any/DT revised/VBN bid/NN would/MD have/VB to/TO include/VB a/DT lower/JJR purchase/NN price/NN to/TO reflect/VB the/DT sharp/JJ drop/NN in/IN UAL/NNP 's/POS stock/NN in/IN the/DT past/NN week/NN ./.
UAL/NNP stock/NN dropped/VBD $/$ #.#/CD yesterday/NN to/TO $/$ #.#/CD on/IN volume/NN of/IN #,#/CD shares/NNS in/IN composite/JJ trading/NN on/IN the/DT New/NNP York/NNP Stock/NNP Exchange/NNP ./.
UAL/NNP declined/VBD to/TO comment/VB on/IN British/NNP Air/NNP 's/POS statement/NN ./.
In/IN an/DT interview/NN Wednesday/NNP with/IN Dow/NNP Jones/NNP Professional/NNP Investor/NNP Report/NNP ,/, Mr./NNP Stevens/NNP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` We/PRP 're/VBP in/IN no/DT way/NN committed/VBN to/TO a/DT deal/NN going/VBG through/RP at/IN all/DT ./.

We/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO be/VB party/NN to/TO a/DT second/JJ rejection/NN ./. ''/''
Indeed/RB ,/, British/NNP Air/NNP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB distancing/VBG itself/PRP from/IN the/DT troubled/VBN transaction/NN early/RB in/IN an/DT effort/NN to/TO avoid/VB any/DT further/JJ embarrassment/NN ./.
The/DT original/JJ transaction/NN fell/VBD through/RP on/IN the/DT same/JJ day/NN British/NNP Air/NNP shareholders/NNS approved/VBD the/DT plan/NN at/IN a/DT special/JJ meeting/NN after/IN the/DT British/NNP succeeded/VBD in/IN arranging/VBG the/DT financing/NN for/IN its/PRP$ equity/NN contribution/NN ./.
The/DT carrier/NN also/RB seemed/VBD eager/JJ to/TO place/VB blame/NN on/IN its/PRP$ American/JJ counterparts/NNS ./.
``/`` The/DT -LCB-/-LRB- buy-out/NN -RCB-/-RRB- consortium/NN ceased/VBD to/TO exist/VB because/IN our/PRP$ American/JJ partners/NNS were/VBD not/RB capable/JJ of/IN organizing/VBG the/DT financing/NN ,/, ''/'' a/DT British/NNP Air/NNP spokesman/NN said/VBD ./.
British/NNP Airways/NNP may/MD have/VBP begun/VBN to/TO have/VB second/JJ thoughts/NNS about/IN the/DT transaction/NN after/IN the/DT Transportation/NNP Department/NNP forced/VBD Northwest/NNP 's/POS Airlines/NNP '/POS new/JJ owners/NNS to/TO restructure/NN the/DT equity/NN contribution/NN of/IN KLM/NNP Royal/NNP Dutch/NNP Airlines/NNP in/IN that/DT carrier/NN ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT department/NN 's/POS statements/NNS since/IN the/DT Northwest/NNP transaction/NN indicated/VBD it/PRP planned/VBD to/TO curtail/VB foreign/JJ ownership/NN stakes/NNS in/IN U.S./NNP carriers/NNS ./.
Even/RB before/IN British/NNP Air/NNP 's/POS announcement/NN ,/, pilot/NN union/NN leaders/NNS had/VBD been/VBN meeting/VBG in/IN Chicago/NNP yesterday/NN to/TO consider/VB their/PRP$ options/NNS ./.
The/DT leaders/NNS expressed/VBD support/NN for/IN trying/VBG to/TO revive/VB the/DT bid/NN following/VBG a/DT briefing/NN Wednesday/NNP by/IN the/DT union/NN 's/POS advisers/NNS ,/, Lazard/NNP Freres/NNP &/CC Co./NNP and/CC Paul/NNP ,/, Weiss/NNP ,/, Rifkind/NNP Wharton/NNP &/CC Garrison/NNP ./.
