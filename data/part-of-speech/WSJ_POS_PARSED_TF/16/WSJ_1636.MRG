IF/IN YOU/PRP FORCE/VBP financial/JJ planners/NNS to/TO sum/VB up/RP their/PRP$ most/RBS important/JJ advice/NN in/IN a/DT single/JJ sentence/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD probably/RB be/VB a/DT one-word/JJ sentence/NN :/: Diversify/VB ./.
Judging/VBG by/IN a/DT poll/NN of/IN Wall/NNP Street/NNP Journal/NNP readers/NNS conducted/VBN this/DT summer/NN by/IN Erdos/NNP &/CC Morgan/NNP Inc./NNP ,/, serious/JJ investors/NNS have/VBP taken/VBN that/DT advice/NN to/TO heart/NN ./.
Nearly/RB #,#/CD investors/NNS responded/VBN to/TO the/DT Journal/NNP 's/POS poll/NN ,/, providing/VBG an/DT in-depth/JJ look/NN at/IN their/PRP$ portfolios/NNS ./.
Those/DT portfolios/NNS are/VBP remarkably/RB diversified/VBN ./.
By/IN spreading/VBG their/PRP$ wealth/NN among/IN several/JJ investment/NN alternatives/NNS ,/, the/DT respondents/NNS have/VBP protected/VBN themselves/PRP against/IN squalls/NNS in/IN any/DT one/CD area/NN ,/, be/VB it/PRP stocks/NNS ,/, bonds/NNS or/CC real/JJ estate/NN ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, about/RB #/CD %/NN of/IN Journal/NNP readers/NNS owned/VBD stock/NN -LRB-/-LRB- down/RB slightly/RB from/IN #/CD %/NN in/IN a/DT similar/JJ poll/NN last/JJ year/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
But/CC only/RB #.#/CD %/NN said/VBD they/PRP had/VBD more/JJR than/IN half/PDT their/PRP$ money/NN in/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN ./.
Similarly/RB ,/, #/CD %/NN of/IN respondents/NNS own/JJ shares/NNS in/IN a/DT money-market/JJ mutual/JJ fund/NN ,/, and/CC #/CD %/NN own/JJ municipal/JJ bonds/NNS ./.
But/CC only/RB #/CD %/NN to/TO #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT investors/NNS were/VBD committing/VBG more/JJR than/IN half/PDT their/PRP$ funds/NNS to/TO either/DT of/IN those/DT alternatives/NNS ./.
The/DT poll/NN ,/, conducted/VBD Aug./NNP #-#/CD ,/, also/RB provides/VBZ a/DT glimpse/NN into/IN the/DT thinking/NN of/IN serious/JJ investors/NNS on/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN other/JJ topics/NNS ./.
It/PRP found/VBD them/PRP in/IN a/DT cautious/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB downbeat/JJ ,/, mood/NN ./.
Of/IN #,#/CD people/NNS sent/VBN a/DT questionnaire/NN ,/, #/CD replied/VBD ./.
The/DT response/NN rate/NN ,/, more/JJR than/IN #/CD %/NN ,/, allows/VBZ the/DT results/NNS to/TO be/VB interpreted/VBN with/IN a/DT high/JJ degree/NN of/IN confidence/NN ./.
The/DT results/NNS ca/MD n't/RB be/VB extrapolated/VBN to/TO all/DT investors/NNS ,/, though/RB ./.
Journal/NNP readers/NNS are/VBP relatively/RB affluent/JJ ,/, with/IN a/DT median/JJ household/NN income/NN of/IN between/IN $/$ #,#/CD and/CC $/$ #,#/CD ./.
Nearly/RB half/NN of/IN the/DT respondents/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- #/CD %/NN -RRB-/-RRB- said/VBD their/PRP$ investment/NN portfolio/NN was/VBD worth/JJ $/$ #,#/CD or/CC more/JJR ,/, and/CC #/CD %/NN said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD worth/JJ $/$ #/CD million/CD or/CC more/JJR ./.
The/DT respondents/NNS were/VBD mildly/RB optimistic/JJ about/IN the/DT economy/NN and/CC investment/NN markets/NNS ,/, but/CC their/PRP$ collective/JJ judgments/NNS were/VBD a/DT notch/NN more/RBR sober/JJ than/IN they/PRP were/VBD a/DT year/NN ago/RB ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, #/CD %/NN of/IN this/DT year/NN 's/POS respondents/NNS said/VBD they/PRP expect/VBP a/DT recession/NN within/IN #/CD months/NNS ./.
Last/JJ year/NN ,/, only/RB #/CD %/NN were/VBD expecting/VBG a/DT recession/NN ./.
An/DT additional/JJ #/CD %/NN of/IN this/DT year/NN 's/POS respondents/NNS expect/VBP the/DT economy/NN to/TO slow/VB down/RP during/IN the/DT next/JJ #/CD months/NNS ./.
Only/RB #/CD %/NN of/IN last/JJ year/NN 's/POS respondents/NNS anticipated/VBD slowing/VBG growth/NN ./.
Apparently/RB ,/, the/DT respondents/NNS do/VBP n't/RB think/VB that/IN an/DT economic/JJ slowdown/NN would/MD harm/VB the/DT major/JJ investment/NN markets/NNS very/RB much/RB ./.
A/DT slim/JJ majority/NN -LRB-/-LRB- #/CD %/NN -RRB-/-RRB- think/VBP stock/NN prices/NNS will/MD be/VB higher/JJR in/IN August/NNP #/CD than/IN they/PRP were/VBD in/IN August/NNP #/CD ./.
Their/PRP$ verdict/NN on/IN real/JJ estate/NN is/VBZ almost/RB the/DT same/JJ ./.
Some/DT #/CD %/NN expect/VBP real/JJ estate/NN in/IN their/PRP$ local/JJ area/NN to/TO increase/VB in/IN value/NN over/IN the/DT next/JJ #/CD months/NNS ./.
By/IN contrast/NN ,/, only/RB #/CD %/NN expect/VBP an/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN gold/NN ./.
Since/IN gold/NN tends/VBZ to/TO soar/VB when/WRB inflation/NN is/VBZ high/JJ ,/, that/DT finding/NN suggests/VBZ that/IN people/NNS believe/VBP inflation/NN remains/VBZ under/IN control/NN ./.
Even/RB though/IN only/RB #/CD %/NN actually/RB predicted/VBD a/DT recession/NN ,/, many/JJ respondents/NNS were/VBD taking/VBG a/DT better-safe-than/JJ sorry/JJ investment/NN stance/NN ./.
Nearly/RB a/DT third/JJ said/VBD they/PRP have/VBP made/VBN some/DT portfolio/NN changes/NNS to/TO anticipate/VB a/DT possible/JJ recession/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT most/JJS part/NN ,/, the/DT changes/NNS were/VBD ``/`` slight/JJ ./. ''/''
The/DT two-thirds/NNS who/WP have/VBP n't/RB tried/VBN to/TO make/VB their/PRP$ portfolios/NNS more/RBR recession-resistant/JJ were/VBD split/VBN about/RB evenly/RB between/IN investors/NNS who/WP ``/`` do/VBP n't/RB believe/VB in/IN trying/VBG to/TO predict/VB the/DT markets/NNS ''/'' -LRB-/-LRB- about/RB #/CD %/NN -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC investors/NNS who/WP ``/`` do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB a/DT recession/NN ''/'' -LRB-/-LRB- about/RB #/CD %/NN -RRB-/-RRB- or/CC are/VBP ``/`` unsure/JJ if/IN and/CC when/WRB a/DT recession/NN might/MD come/VB ''/'' -LRB-/-LRB- about/RB #/CD %/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
A/DT buy-and-hold/JJ approach/NN to/TO stocks/NNS continues/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT rule/NN among/IN respondents/NNS ./.
Most/JJS own/VBP two/CD to/TO #/CD stocks/NNS ,/, and/CC buy/VBP or/CC sell/VBP no/RB more/JJR than/IN three/CD times/NNS a/DT year/NN ./.
Some/DT #/CD %/NN had/VBD bought/VBN some/DT stock/NN in/IN the/DT past/JJ year/NN ;/: only/RB #/CD %/NN had/VBD sold/VBN any/DT ./.
But/CC the/DT lurking/VBG shadow/NN of/IN #/CD 's/POS stock-market/NN crash/NN still/RB seems/VBZ dark/JJ ./.
About/RB #/CD %/NN considered/VBD another/DT crash/NN ``/`` likely/RB ,/, ''/'' while/IN about/RB #/CD %/NN said/VBD one/CD is/VBZ ``/`` unlikely/JJ ./. ''/''
Those/DT percentages/NNS hardly/RB changed/VBD from/IN the/DT previous/JJ year/NN 's/POS poll/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT respondents/NNS '/POS commitment/NN to/TO the/DT stock/NN market/NN remains/VBZ somewhat/RB lighter/JJR than/IN usual/JJ ./.
About/RB #/CD %/NN of/IN them/PRP said/VBD they/PRP would/MD ``/`` ordinarily/RB ''/'' have/VB at/IN least/JJS #/CD %/NN of/IN their/PRP$ money/NN in/IN stocks/NNS ./.

Most/JJS stock-market/NN indexes/NNS were/VBD hitting/VBG all-time/JJ highs/NNS at/IN around/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN the/DT poll/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP appears/VBZ that/IN many/JJ Journal/NNP readers/NNS were/VBD taking/VBG that/DT news/NN as/IN a/DT sign/NN to/TO be/VB cautious/JJ ,/, rather/RB than/IN a/DT signal/NN to/TO jump/VB on/IN the/DT bandwagon/NN ./.
