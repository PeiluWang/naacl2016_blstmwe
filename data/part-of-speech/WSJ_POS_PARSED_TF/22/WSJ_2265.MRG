One/CD analyst/NN ,/, Peter/NNP Cardillo/NNP of/IN Josephthal/NNP &/CC Co./NNP ,/, New/NNP York/NNP ,/, said/VBD the/DT gold/NN market/NN already/RB had/VBD some/DT good/JJ price-supporting/JJ technical/JJ factors/NNS that/WDT would/MD have/VB caused/VBN prices/NNS to/TO rise/VB ,/, with/IN or/CC without/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT recovery/NN in/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN provided/VBD little/JJ help/NN for/IN copper/NN as/IN word/NN spread/VBD that/IN a/DT three-month/JJ strike/NN at/IN the/DT Highland/NNP Valley/NNP mine/NN in/IN British/NNP Columbia/NNP was/VBD about/RB over/RB ,/, according/VBG to/TO an/DT analyst/NN ./.
