The/DT exemption/NN allowed/VBN on/IN longer/JJR flights/NNS to/TO Alaska/NNP and/CC Hawaii/NNP appears/VBZ to/TO be/VB largely/RB a/DT face-saving/JJ concession/NN for/IN the/DT traditionally/RB powerful/JJ tobacco/NN industry/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ found/VBN itself/PRP increasingly/RB isolated/VBN in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN public/JJ pressure/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ./.
