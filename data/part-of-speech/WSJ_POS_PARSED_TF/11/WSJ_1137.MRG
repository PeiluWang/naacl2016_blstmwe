The/DT Voting/NNP Rights/NNP Act/NNP of/IN #/CD was/VBD enacted/VBN to/TO keep/VB the/DT promise/NN of/IN the/DT Fifteenth/NNP Amendment/NNP and/CC enable/VB Southern/JJ blacks/NNS to/TO go/VB to/TO the/DT polls/NNS ,/, unhindered/JJ by/IN literacy/NN tests/NNS and/CC other/JJ exclusionary/JJ devices/NNS ./.
Twenty-five/CD years/NNS later/RB ,/, the/DT Voting/NNP Rights/NNP Act/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN transformed/VBN by/IN the/DT courts/NNS and/CC the/DT Justice/NNP Department/NNP into/IN a/DT program/NN of/IN racial/JJ gerrymandering/NN designed/VBN to/TO increase/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN blacks/NNS and/CC other/JJ minorities/NNS --/: Hispanics/NNPS ,/, Asians/NNPS and/CC native/JJ Americans/NNPS --/: holding/VBG elective/JJ office/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT #s/CD ,/, the/DT Justice/NNP Department/NNP and/CC lower/JJR federal/JJ courts/NNS that/WDT enforce/VBP the/DT Voting/NNP Rights/NNP Act/NNP have/VBP required/VBN state/NN legislatures/NNS and/CC municipal/JJ governments/NNS to/TO create/VB the/DT maximum/JJ number/NN of/IN ``/`` safe/JJ ''/'' minority/NN election/NN districts/NNS --/: districts/NNS where/WRB minorities/NNS form/VBP between/IN #/CD %/NN and/CC #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT voting/VBG population/NN ./.

Although/IN Section/NNP #/CD of/IN the/DT act/NN expressly/RB disclaims/VBZ requiring/VBG that/IN minorities/NNS win/VB a/DT proportional/JJ share/NN of/IN elective/JJ offices/NNS ,/, few/JJ municipal/NN and/CC state/NN government/NN plans/NNS achieve/VBP preclearance/NN by/IN the/DT Justice/NNP Department/NNP or/CC survive/VBP the/DT scrutiny/NN of/IN the/DT lower/JJR federal/JJ courts/NNS unless/IN they/PRP carve/VBP out/RP as/RB many/JJ solidly/RB minority/NN districts/NNS as/IN possible/JJ ./.
The/DT new/JJ goal/NN of/IN the/DT Voting/NNP Rights/NNP Act/NNP --/: more/JJR minorities/NNS in/IN political/JJ office/NN --/: is/VBZ laudable/JJ ./.
For/IN the/DT political/JJ process/NN to/TO work/VB ,/, all/DT citizens/NNS ,/, regardless/RB of/IN race/NN ,/, must/MD feel/VB represented/VBN ./.
One/CD essential/JJ indicator/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP is/VBZ that/IN members/NNS of/IN minority/NN groups/NNS get/VBP elected/VBN to/TO public/JJ office/NN with/IN reasonable/JJ frequency/NN ./.
As/IN is/VBZ ,/, blacks/NNS constitute/VBP #/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT population/NN ,/, but/CC fewer/JJR than/IN #/CD %/NN of/IN elected/JJ leaders/NNS ./.
But/CC racial/JJ gerrymandering/NN is/VBZ not/RB the/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO accomplish/VB that/DT essential/JJ goal/NN ./.

Far/RB from/IN promoting/VBG a/DT commonality/NN of/IN interests/NNS among/IN black/JJ ,/, white/JJ ,/, Hispanic/JJ and/CC other/JJ minority/NN voters/NNS ,/, drawing/VBG the/DT district/NN lines/NNS according/VBG to/TO race/NN suggests/VBZ that/DT race/NN is/VBZ the/DT voter/NN 's/POS and/CC the/DT candidate/NN 's/VBZ most/RBS important/JJ trait/NN ./.
Such/PDT a/DT policy/NN implies/VBZ that/IN only/RB a/DT black/JJ politician/NN can/MD speak/VB for/IN a/DT black/JJ person/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN only/RB a/DT white/JJ politician/NN can/MD govern/VB on/IN behalf/NN of/IN a/DT white/JJ one/CD ./.

Racial/JJ gerrymandering/NN has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT familiar/JJ policy/NN in/IN New/NNP York/NNP City/NNP since/IN #/CD ,/, when/WRB Congress/NNP first/RB amended/VBD the/DT Voting/NNP Rights/NNP Act/NNP to/TO expand/VB its/PRP$ reach/NN beyond/IN the/DT Southern/JJ states/NNS ./.
In/IN #/CD ,/, the/DT Justice/NNP Department/NNP required/VBD that/IN the/DT electoral/JJ map/NN in/IN the/DT borough/NN of/IN Brooklyn/NNP be/VB redrawn/JJ to/TO concentrate/VB black/JJ and/CC Hispanic/JJ votes/NNS ,/, despite/IN protests/NNS that/IN the/DT new/JJ electoral/JJ boundaries/NNS would/MD split/VB a/DT neighborhood/NN of/IN Hasidic/JJ Jews/NNPS into/IN two/CD different/JJ districts/NNS ./.
This/DT year/NN ,/, a/DT commission/NN appointed/VBN by/IN the/DT mayor/NN to/TO revise/VB New/NNP York/NNP 's/POS system/NN of/IN government/NN completed/VBD a/DT new/JJ charter/NN ,/, expanding/VBG the/DT City/NNP Council/NNP to/TO #/CD from/IN #/CD members/NNS ./.

The/DT Charter/NNP Revision/NNP Commission/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN it/PRP clear/JJ that/IN in/IN response/NN to/TO the/DT expectations/NNS of/IN the/DT Justice/NNP Department/NNP and/CC the/DT commission/NN 's/POS own/JJ commitment/NN to/TO enhancing/VBG minority/NN political/JJ leadership/NN ,/, the/DT new/JJ district/NN lines/NNS will/MD be/VB drawn/VBN to/TO maximize/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN solidly/RB minority/NN districts/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT connection/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO note/VB that/IN several/JJ members/NNS of/IN New/NNP York/NNP 's/POS sitting/VBG City/NNP Council/NNP represent/VBP heterogeneous/JJ districts/NNS that/WDT bring/VBP together/RB sizable/JJ black/JJ ,/, Hispanic/JJ ,/, and/CC non-Hispanic/JJ white/JJ populations/NNS --/: Carolyn/NNP Maloney/NNP 's/POS #th/JJ district/NN in/IN northern/JJ Manhattan/NNP and/CC the/DT south/JJ Bronx/NNP and/CC Susan/NNP Alter/NNP 's/POS #th/JJ district/NN in/IN Brooklyn/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ./.
To/TO win/VB their/PRP$ seats/NNS on/IN the/DT council/NN ,/, these/DT political/JJ leaders/NNS have/VBP had/VBD to/TO listen/VB to/TO all/PDT the/DT voices/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ district/NN and/CC devise/VB public/JJ policies/NNS that/WDT would/MD benefit/VB all/DT ./.

The/DT unusual/JJ situation/NN in/IN Birmingham/NNP vividly/RB illustrates/VBZ the/DT divisive/JJ consequences/NNS of/IN carving/VBG out/RP safe/JJ districts/NNS for/IN racial/JJ minorities/NNS ./.

Insisting/VBG that/IN they/PRP are/VBP protected/VBN by/IN the/DT Voting/NNP Rights/NNP Act/NNP ,/, a/DT group/NN of/IN whites/NNS brought/VBD a/DT federal/JJ suit/NN in/IN #/CD to/TO demand/VB that/IN the/DT city/NN abandon/VB at-large/JJ voting/NN for/IN the/DT nine/CD member/NN City/NNP Council/NNP and/CC create/VB nine/CD electoral/JJ districts/NNS ,/, including/VBG four/CD safe/JJ white/JJ districts/NNS ./.
The/DT white/JJ group/NN argued/VBD that/IN whites/NNS were/VBD not/RB fully/RB and/CC fairly/RB represented/VBN ,/, because/IN in/IN city-wide/JJ elections/NNS only/RB black/JJ candidates/NNS or/CC white/JJ candidates/NNS who/WP catered/VBD to/TO ``/`` black/JJ interests/NNS ''/'' could/MD win/VB ./.
