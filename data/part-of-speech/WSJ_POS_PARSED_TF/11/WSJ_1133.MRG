President/NNP Bush/NNP is/VBZ considering/VBG casting/VBG a/DT line-item/JJ veto/NN as/IN a/DT test/NN to/TO determine/VB whether/IN the/DT courts/NNS will/MD rule/VB that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ such/JJ authority/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Bush/NNP has/VBZ long/RB campaigned/VBN for/IN passage/NN of/IN a/DT bill/NN or/CC a/DT constitutional/JJ amendment/NN that/WDT would/MD explicitly/RB give/VB him/PRP a/DT line-item/JJ veto/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD enable/VB him/PRP to/TO kill/VB individual/JJ items/NNS in/IN a/DT big/JJ spending/NN bill/NN without/IN having/VBG to/TO kill/VB the/DT entire/JJ bill/NN ./.
He/PRP has/VBZ argued/VBN that/IN such/JJ presidential/JJ power/NN is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO rein/VB in/RP congressional/JJ spending/NN ./.
But/CC some/DT analysts/NNS ,/, particularly/RB conservative/JJ legal/JJ scholars/NNS ,/, have/VBP urged/VBN Mr./NNP Bush/NNP not/RB to/TO wait/VB for/IN explicit/JJ authorization/NN but/CC simply/RB to/TO assert/VB that/IN the/DT Constitution/NNP already/RB implicitly/RB gives/VBZ him/PRP the/DT power/NN to/TO exercise/VB a/DT line-item/JJ veto/NN ./.
Such/PDT an/DT assertion/NN most/RBS likely/RB would/MD bring/VB about/RP a/DT court/NN challenge/NN from/IN Congress/NNP that/WDT would/MD clarify/VB whether/IN a/DT president/NN already/RB has/VBZ such/JJ power/NN ./.
White/NNP House/NNP spokesman/NN Marlin/NNP Fitzwater/NNP ,/, confirming/VBG comments/NNS made/VBN this/DT week/NN by/IN Vice/NNP President/NNP Dan/NNP Quayle/NNP ,/, said/VBD Mr./NNP Bush/NNP is/VBZ ``/`` interested/JJ ''/'' in/IN finding/VBG a/DT suitable/JJ test/NN case/NN ./.
But/CC he/PRP also/RB said/VBD that/IN exercising/VBG a/DT test/NN line-item/JJ veto/NN is/VBZ n't/RB a/DT ``/`` top/JJ initiative/NN ''/'' on/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS agenda/NN because/IN he/PRP faces/VBZ more-pressing/JJ budget/NN issues/NNS at/IN the/DT moment/NN ./.
