The/DT talk/NN of/IN a/DT sales/NNS tax/NN rise/NN follows/VBZ a/DT rebuff/NN from/IN Congress/NNP on/IN the/DT question/NN of/IN how/WRB much/JJ the/DT federal/JJ government/NN is/VBZ willing/JJ to/TO spend/VB to/TO aid/NN in/IN California/NNP 's/POS earthquake/NN relief/NN efforts/NNS ./.
The/DT state/NN had/VBD sought/VBN as/RB much/JJ as/IN $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD in/IN relief/NN ,/, but/CC yesterday/NN the/DT House/NNP approved/VBD a/DT more/RBR general/JJ scaled-back/JJ measure/NN calling/VBG for/IN $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD in/IN aid/NN ,/, the/DT bulk/NN of/IN which/WDT would/MD go/VB to/TO California/NNP ,/, with/IN an/DT unspecified/JJ amount/NN going/VBG to/TO regions/NNS affected/VBN by/IN Hurricane/NNP Hugo/NNP ./.
That/DT leaves/VBZ the/DT state/NN roughly/RB $/$ #/CD billion/CD to/TO $/$ #/CD billion/CD short/JJ ./.
A/DT sales/NNS tax/NN increase/NN appears/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT fastest/JJS and/CC easiest/JJS to/TO raise/VB funds/NNS in/IN a/DT hurry/NN ./.
According/VBG to/TO the/DT state/NN department/NN of/IN finance/NN ,/, a/DT one-penny/JJ increase/NN in/IN the/DT state/NN 's/POS six-cent/JJ per/IN dollar/NN sales/NNS tax/NN could/MD raise/VB $/$ #/CD billion/CD ./.
Willie/NNP Brown/NNP ,/, speaker/NN of/IN California/NNP 's/POS Assembly/NN ,/, said/VBD that/IN Gov./NNP George/NNP Deukmejian/NNP has/VBZ agreed/VBN to/TO schedule/VB a/DT special/JJ session/NN of/IN the/DT legislature/NN within/IN two/CD weeks/NNS ./.
California/NNP 's/POS so-called/JJ Gann/NNP limit/NN effectively/RB prevents/VBZ the/DT state/NN from/IN spending/VBG new/JJ tax/NN money/NN and/CC so/RB drastically/RB limits/VBZ its/PRP$ options/NNS in/IN an/DT emergency/NN ./.
Both/CC Mr./NNP Brown/NNP ,/, the/DT state/NN 's/VBZ most/RBS influential/JJ legislator/NN ,/, and/CC Gov./NNP Deukmejian/NNP favor/VBP a/DT temporary/JJ sales/NNS tax/NN increase/NN --/: should/MD more/JJR money/NN be/VB needed/VBN than/IN the/DT state/NN can/MD raise/VB from/IN existing/JJ sources/NNS and/CC the/DT federal/JJ government/NN ./.
According/VBG to/TO a/DT spokesman/NN ,/, the/DT governor/NN is/VBZ also/RB studying/VBG the/DT possibility/NN of/IN raising/VBG state/NN gasoline/NN taxes/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Brown/NNP ,/, meanwhile/RB ,/, believes/VBZ ``/`` only/RB one/CD tax/NN will/MD be/VB feasible/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PRP will/MD be/VB a/DT one-penny/JJ sales/NNS tax/NN increase/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Chuck/NNP Dalldorf/NNP ,/, an/DT aide/NN ./.
One/CD immediate/JJ source/NN of/IN money/NN is/VBZ an/DT emergency/NN fund/NN set/VBD up/RP by/IN Gov./NNP Deukmejian/NNP ./.
The/DT fund/NN has/VBZ about/RB $/$ #/CD billion/CD and/CC is/VBZ set/VBN up/RP to/TO handle/VB ``/`` precisely/RB the/DT kind/NN of/IN emergency/NN ''/'' the/DT state/NN faces/VBZ ,/, said/VBD Tom/NNP Beermann/NNP ,/, the/DT Governor/NNP 's/POS deputy/JJ press/NN secretary/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT fund/NN 's/POS size/NN is/VBZ disputed/VBN by/IN Mr./NNP Brown/NNP 's/POS office/NN ,/, which/WDT estimates/VBZ the/DT fund/NN holds/VBZ from/IN $/$ #/CD million/CD to/TO $/$ #/CD million/CD ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, an/DT aide/NN to/TO Mr./NNP Brown/NNP said/VBD Gov./NNP Deukmejian/NNP ``/`` has/VBZ expressed/VBN a/DT desire/NN not/RB to/TO spend/VB all/PDT the/DT reserve/NN on/IN this/DT ./. ''/''
To/TO push/VB through/RP a/DT sales/NNS tax/NN increase/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, the/DT state/NN will/MD have/VB to/TO suspend/VB the/DT Gann/NNP limit/NN ,/, citing/VBG an/DT emergency/NN ./.
And/CC then/RB it/PRP will/MD be/VB required/VBN to/TO lower/VB taxes/NNS by/IN a/DT corresponding/JJ amount/NN during/IN a/DT three-year/JJ period/NN after/IN the/DT temporary/JJ tax/NN increase/NN ends/VBZ ,/, said/VBD Cindy/NNP Katz/NNP ,/, assistant/JJ director/NN of/IN the/DT state/NN department/NN of/IN finance/NN ./.
A/DT sales/NNS tax/NN increase/NN would/MD require/VB two-thirds/NNS approval/NN in/IN both/DT houses/NNS of/IN the/DT state/NN 's/POS legislature/NN ./.
But/CC observers/NNS expect/VBP broad/JJ support/NN ./.
``/`` If/IN there/EX 's/VBZ an/DT emergency/NN and/CC there/EX are/VBP n't/RB sufficient/JJ funds/NNS from/IN elsewhere/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP the/DT attitude/NN will/MD be/VB supportive/JJ ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Kirk/NNP West/NNP ,/, president/NN of/IN the/DT California/NNP Chamber/NNP of/IN Commerce/NNP ./.

Since/IN the/DT late/JJ #s/NNS ,/, California/NNP property/NN owners/NNS have/VBP benefited/VBN from/IN a/DT tax/NN rollback/NN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN a/DT state/NN ballot/NN initiative/NN known/VBN as/IN Proposition/NNP #/CD ./.
The/DT state/NN could/MD also/RB increase/VB gasoline/NN taxes/NNS ;/: every/DT one/CD penny/NN increase/NN in/IN the/DT tax/NN would/MD yield/VB $/$ #/CD million/CD a/DT month/NN ./.
But/CC Gov./NNP Deukmejian/NNP and/CC others/NNS are/VBP reluctant/JJ to/TO do/VB anything/NN to/TO harm/VB the/DT state/NN 's/POS chances/NNS of/IN sharply/RB raising/VBG gasoline/NN taxes/NNS on/IN a/DT permanent/JJ basis/NN ./.
To/TO raise/VB more/JJR highway/NN funds/NNS ,/, a/DT measure/NN to/TO double/VB the/DT state/NN 's/POS nine-cent/JJ a/DT gallon/NN tax/NN over/IN five/CD years/NNS is/VBZ set/VBN to/TO appear/VB on/IN the/DT state/NN 's/POS June/NNP election/NN ballot/NN ./.
But/CC some/DT fear/VBP imposing/VBG a/DT temporary/JJ gasoline/NN tax/NN increase/NN in/IN the/DT meantime/NN could/MD undercut/VB support/NN among/IN voters/NNS for/IN the/DT measure/NN ./.
Not/RB everyone/NN is/VBZ convinced/VBN the/DT state/NN must/MD raise/VB new/JJ revenue/NN to/TO meet/VB its/PRP$ earthquake/NN needs/NNS ./.
``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ possible/JJ ,/, though/IN not/RB probable/JJ ,/, ''/'' that/IN the/DT state/NN could/MD get/VB by/RP with/IN its/PRP$ existing/JJ resources/NNS and/CC federal/JJ help/NN ,/, said/VBD Quentin/NNP Kopp/NNP ,/, chairman/NN of/IN the/DT state/NN senate/NN 's/POS transportation/NN committee/NN ./.

The/DT men/NNS can/MD defeat/VB immunities/NNS that/IN states/NNS often/RB assert/VBP in/IN court/NN by/IN showing/VBG that/IN officials/NNS knew/VBD or/CC should/MD have/VB known/VBN that/DT design/NN of/IN the/DT structure/NN was/VBD defective/JJ and/CC that/IN they/PRP failed/VBD to/TO make/VB reasonable/JJ changes/NNS ./.
