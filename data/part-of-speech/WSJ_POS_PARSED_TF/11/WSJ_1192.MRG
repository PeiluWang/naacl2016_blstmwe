The/DT airline/NN industry/NN 's/POS fortunes/NNS ,/, in/IN dazzling/JJ shape/NN for/IN most/RBS of/IN the/DT year/NN ,/, have/VBP taken/VBN a/DT sudden/JJ turn/NN for/IN the/DT worse/JJR in/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ weeks/NNS ./.
Citing/VBG rising/VBG fuel/NN costs/NNS ,/, promotional/JJ fare/NN cuts/NNS and/CC a/DT general/JJ slowdown/NN in/IN travel/NN ,/, several/JJ major/JJ carriers/NNS have/VBP posted/VBN or/CC are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO post/VB relatively/RB poor/JJ third-quarter/JJ results/NNS ./.
Yesterday/NN ,/, USAir/NNP Group/NNP Inc./NNP ,/, recently/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT industry/NN 's/POS stellar/JJ performers/NNS ,/, posted/VBD a/DT worse-than-expected/JJ $/$ #.#/CD million/CD net/JJ loss/NN for/IN the/DT period/NN ./.
So/RB far/RB ,/, the/DT industry/NN 's/POS fourth/JJ quarter/NN is/VBZ n't/RB looking/VBG too/RB strong/JJ either/RB ,/, prompting/VBG many/JJ analysts/NNS to/TO slash/VB earning/NN projections/NNS for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN by/IN as/RB much/JJ as/IN one-fourth/NN ./.
And/CC they/PRP say/VBP the/DT outlook/NN for/IN #/CD is/VBZ nearly/RB as/RB bad/JJ ./.
Airlines/NNS in/IN #/CD ``/`` came/VBD in/IN like/IN a/DT bang/NN and/CC are/VBP going/VBG out/IN like/IN a/DT whimper/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Kevin/NNP Murphy/NNP ,/, an/DT airline/NN analyst/NN at/IN Morgan/NNP Stanley/NNP &/CC Co/NNP ./.
This/DT turn/NN of/IN events/NNS has/VBZ put/VBN a/DT big/JJ damper/NN on/IN an/DT industry/NN that/WDT seemed/VBD almost/RB invincible/JJ last/JJ spring/NN ,/, when/WRB fares/NNS were/VBD rising/VBG at/IN double-digit/JJ rates/NNS and/CC many/JJ carriers/NNS seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB growing/VBG fat/JJ on/IN near-monopolies/NNS in/IN certain/JJ markets/NNS ./.
Now/RB ,/, many/JJ airline/NN companies/NNS might/MD become/VB a/DT lot/NN less/RBR attractive/JJ as/IN takeover/NN targets/NNS on/IN Wall/NNP Street/NNP ./.
The/DT downturn/NN also/RB raises/VBZ questions/NNS about/IN the/DT carriers/NNS '/POS ambitious/JJ orders/NNS for/IN new/JJ airplanes/NNS ,/, which/WDT currently/RB total/VBP $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD over/IN the/DT next/JJ three/CD years/NNS ./.
For/IN travelers/NNS ,/, though/RB ,/, the/DT industry/NN 's/POS problems/NNS have/VBP had/VBD some/DT positive/JJ effects/NNS ./.
In/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS ,/, airlines/NNS have/VBP cut/VBN numerous/JJ fares/NNS in/IN leisure/NN markets/NNS to/TO try/VB to/TO win/VB back/RP customers/NNS ./.
Others/NNS have/VBP tried/VBN to/TO spruce/VB up/RP frequent-flier/JJ programs/NNS ./.
Previously/RB ,/, airlines/NNS were/VBD limiting/VBG the/DT programs/NNS because/IN they/PRP were/VBD becoming/VBG too/RB expensive/JJ ./.
Just/RB last/JJ week/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, Trans/NNP World/NNP Airlines/NNP and/CC Pan/NNP Am/NNP Corp./NNP 's/POS Pan/NNP American/NNP World/NNP Airways/NNP went/VBD so/RB far/RB as/IN to/TO offer/VB cash/NN rebates/NNS or/CC gift/NN checks/NNS of/IN $/$ #/CD to/TO $/$ #,#/CD to/TO certain/JJ frequent-flier/JJ members/NNS making/VBG trans-Atlantic/JJ flights/NNS in/IN business/NN class/NN or/CC first/JJ class/NN ./.
The/DT industry/NN 's/POS slowdown/NN became/VBD apparent/JJ this/DT month/NN when/WRB AMR/NNP Corp./NNP ,/, parent/NN of/IN American/NNP Airlines/NNP ,/, reported/VBD an/DT #.#/CD %/NN drop/NN in/IN third-quarter/JJ net/JJ income/NN and/CC said/VBD its/PRP$ fourth/JJ quarter/NN would/MD be/VB ``/`` disappointing/JJ ./.

Shortly/RB before/IN that/DT ,/, USAir/NNP had/VBD said/VBD its/PRP$ third-quarter/JJ results/NNS would/MD be/VB ``/`` significantly/RB lower/JJR ''/'' than/IN a/DT year/NN earlier/RBR ./.
Yesterday/NN ,/, it/PRP provided/VBD the/DT details/NNS :/:
Its/PRP$ loss/NN of/IN $/$ #.#/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC $/$ #.#/CD a/DT share/NN ,/, contrasted/VBN with/IN net/NN of/IN $/$ #.#/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC $/$ #.#/CD a/DT share/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT #/CD third/JJ quarter/NN ./.
Revenue/NN rose/VBD only/RB #.#/CD %/NN in/IN the/DT latest/JJS period/NN ,/, to/TO $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD from/IN $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD ./.
For/IN the/DT nine/CD months/NNS ,/, the/DT Arlington/NNP ,/, Va./NNP ,/, company/NN 's/POS net/NN plunged/VBD #/CD %/NN to/TO $/$ #.#/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC #/CD cents/NNS a/DT share/NN ,/, from/IN $/$ #.#/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC $/$ #.#/CD a/DT share/NN ./.
Revenue/NN rose/VBD #/CD %/NN to/TO $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD from/IN $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD ./.
The/DT results/NNS surprised/VBD many/JJ analysts/NNS ,/, because/IN USAir/NNP has/VBZ almost/RB no/DT competition/NN in/IN its/PRP$ Pittsburgh/NNP hub/NN and/CC has/VBZ expanded/VBN operations/NNS by/IN completing/VBG its/PRP$ acquisition/NN of/IN Piedmont/NNP Airlines/NNP ./.
Shortly/RB after/IN announcing/VBG its/PRP$ quarterly/JJ loss/NN ,/, USAir/NNP 's/POS stock/NN tumbled/VBD $/$ #/CD a/DT share/NN ./.
It/PRP ended/VBD at/IN $/$ #.#/CD ,/, down/RB $/$ #.#/CD ,/, in/IN New/NNP York/NNP Stock/NNP Exchange/NNP composite/JJ trading/NN ./.
``/`` Nobody/NN was/VBD expecting/VBG this/DT size/NN of/IN a/DT loss/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Paul/NNP Karos/NNP ,/, an/DT analyst/NN with/IN First/NNP Boston/NNP Corp/NNP ./.
One/CD airline/NN executive/NN ,/, who/WP declined/VBD to/TO be/VB identified/VBN ,/, called/VBD the/DT loss/NN ``/`` amazing/JJ ./. ''/''
In/IN announcing/VBG the/DT results/NNS ,/, USAir/NNP cited/VBD many/JJ of/IN the/DT same/JJ problems/NNS that/IN several/JJ other/JJ industry/NN officials/NNS have/VBP named/VBN recently/RB ./.
It/PRP said/VBD the/DT industry/NN 's/POS domestic/JJ traffic/NN was/VBD flat/JJ in/IN the/DT third/JJ quarter/NN ;/: analysts/NNS say/VBP this/DT was/VBD because/RB hefty/JJ fare/NN increases/NNS earlier/RBR in/IN the/DT year/NN scared/VBD off/RP many/JJ leisure/NN travelers/NNS this/DT summer/NN ./.
To/TO try/VB to/TO combat/VB the/DT traffic/NN slowdown/NN ,/, airlines/NNS started/VBD reducing/VBG fares/NNS ;/: average/JJ fares/NNS rose/VBD only/RB #.#/CD %/NN in/IN August/NNP ,/, in/IN contrast/NN to/TO increases/NNS of/IN #/CD %/NN each/DT in/IN February/NNP and/CC March/NNP ./.
But/CC so/RB far/RB ,/, the/DT effort/NN has/VBZ failed/VBN ,/, and/CC traffic/NN is/VBZ still/RB slow/JJ ./.
Some/DT other/JJ fare/NN promotions/NNS have/VBP backfired/VBN ./.
This/DT summer/NN ,/, the/DT industry/NN introduced/VBD a/DT ``/`` kids/NNS fly/VBP free/JJ ''/'' program/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT children/NNS were/VBD allowed/VBN to/TO fly/VB free/JJ if/IN they/PRP were/VBD traveling/VBG with/IN an/DT adult/NN ./.
Airlines/NNS tried/VBD to/TO restrict/VB the/DT program/NN substantially/RB by/IN limiting/VBG the/DT offer/NN to/TO certain/JJ days/NNS of/IN the/DT week/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP still/RB was/VBD apparently/RB used/VBN far/RB more/RBR heavily/RB than/IN the/DT airlines/NNS expected/VBD ./.
Airlines/NNS also/RB say/VBP their/PRP$ frequent-flier/JJ programs/NNS are/VBP squeezing/VBG profits/NNS because/IN awards/NNS are/VBP being/VBG redeemed/VBN at/IN a/DT heavier-than-normal/JJ rate/NN ./.
One/CD airline/NN official/NN said/VBD about/RB three/CD times/NNS as/IN many/JJ free-travel/JJ coupons/NNS are/VBP being/VBG turned/VBN in/RP as/IN in/IN previous/JJ years/NNS --/: not/RB surprisingly/RB ,/, as/IN the/DT airlines/NNS last/JJ year/NN allowed/VBD many/JJ travelers/NNS to/TO build/VB up/RP mileage/NN at/IN triple/RB the/DT normal/JJ rate/NN ./.
Rising/VBG operating/NN expenses/NNS are/VBP another/DT problem/NN ./.
Fuel/NN costs/NNS were/VBD up/RB #/CD %/NN in/IN the/DT third/JJ quarter/NN ./.
Labor/NN costs/NNS ,/, which/WDT leveled/VBD off/RP in/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS because/IN of/IN lower/JJR pay/NN scales/NNS for/IN newer/JJR employees/NNS ,/, are/VBP on/IN the/DT upswing/NN again/RB at/IN many/JJ carriers/NNS ./.
And/CC some/DT carriers/NNS are/VBP facing/VBG other/JJ unexpected/JJ headaches/NNS :/: USAir/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, blamed/VBD some/DT of/IN its/PRP$ loss/NN on/IN merger/NN expenses/NNS and/CC on/IN disruptions/NNS caused/VBN by/IN Hurricane/NNP Hugo/NNP last/JJ month/NN ./.
``/`` We/PRP can/MD not/RB quantify/VB the/DT total/JJ adverse/JJ effects/NNS of/IN Hugo/NNP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Edwin/NNP Colodny/NNP ,/, chairman/NN and/CC president/NN of/IN USAir/NNP Group/NNP ./.
Whatever/WDT the/DT cause/NN for/IN the/DT downturn/NN ,/, few/JJ people/NNS are/VBP predicting/VBG any/DT sudden/JJ improvement/NN ./.
