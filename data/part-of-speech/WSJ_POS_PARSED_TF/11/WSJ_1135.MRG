The/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN said/VBD it/PRP is/VBZ submitting/VBG a/DT ``/`` comprehensive/JJ ''/'' proposal/NN for/IN overhauling/VBG agricultural/JJ trade/NN that/WDT could/MD help/VB break/VB an/DT impasse/NN in/IN the/DT current/JJ round/NN of/IN multilateral/JJ trade/NN negotiations/NNS ./.
The/DT proposal/NN reiterates/VBZ the/DT U.S./NNP desire/NN to/TO scrap/VB or/CC reduce/VB a/DT host/NN of/IN trade-distorting/JJ subsidies/NNS on/IN farm/NN products/NNS ./.
But/CC it/PRP would/MD allow/VB considerable/JJ flexibility/NN in/IN determining/VBG how/WRB and/CC when/WRB these/DT goals/NNS would/MD be/VB achieved/VBN ./.
The/DT U.S./NNP plan/NN also/RB would/MD ease/VB the/DT transition/NN to/TO freer/JJR agriculture/NN trade/NN by/IN allowing/VBG some/DT countries/NNS to/TO convert/VB non-tariff/JJ barriers/NNS into/IN tariffs/NNS that/WDT ,/, together/RB with/IN existing/JJ tariffs/NNS ,/, then/RB would/MD be/VB phased/VBN out/RP over/IN #/CD years/NNS ./.
Trade/NNP Representative/NNP Carla/NNP Hills/NNP ,/, who/WP along/IN with/IN Agriculture/NNP Secretary/NNP Clayton/NNP Yeutter/NNP unveiled/VBD the/DT proposal/NN ,/, said/VBD she/PRP is/VBZ confident/JJ it/PRP will/MD gain/VB considerable/JJ support/NN from/IN the/DT U.S./NNP 's/POS trading/NN partners/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Yeutter/NNP ,/, seeking/VBG to/TO allay/VB European/JJ objections/NNS to/TO an/DT earlier/JJR U.S./NNP plan/NN that/WDT called/VBD for/IN eliminating/VBG all/DT farm-trade/JJ barriers/NNS by/IN the/DT year/NN #/CD ,/, said/VBD the/DT new/JJ U.S./NNP proposal/NN would/MD n't/RB ``/`` put/VB farmers/NNS out/IN of/IN business/NN ''/'' but/CC would/MD only/RB encourage/VB them/PRP to/TO ``/`` grow/VB what/WP the/DT markets/NNS desire/VBP instead/RB of/IN what/WP the/DT government/NN wants/VBZ ./. ''/''
The/DT U.S./NNP is/VBZ submitting/VBG the/DT proposal/NN today/NN in/IN Geneva/NNP ,/, hoping/VBG that/IN the/DT initiative/NN will/MD spur/VB members/NNS of/IN the/DT General/NNP Agreement/NNP on/IN Tariffs/NNP and/CC Trade/NNP to/TO reach/VB agreement/NN on/IN new/JJ trade/NN rules/NNS before/IN their/PRP$ current/JJ negotiating/NN round/NN concludes/VBZ in/IN December/NNP #/CD ./.
Another/DT U.S./NNP proposal/NN filed/VBN Monday/NNP urges/VBZ more/JJR ``/`` fair/JJ play/NN ''/'' in/IN services/NNS trade/NN ,/, including/VBG predictable/JJ and/CC clear/JJ rules/NNS and/CC equality/NN in/IN the/DT treatment/NN of/IN foreign/JJ and/CC domestic/JJ service/NN companies/NNS ./.
Unlike/IN the/DT earlier/JJR U.S./NNP farm-trade/JJ proposal/NN which/WDT struck/VBD European/JJ countries/NNS as/RB too/RB extreme/JJ ,/, the/DT latest/JJS plan/NN would/MD provide/VB some/DT room/NN for/IN maneuver/NN ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, the/DT new/JJ U.S./NNP package/NN makes/VBZ clear/JJ there/EX would/MD be/VB a/DT transition/NN period/NN during/IN which/WDT GATT/NNP members/NNS could/MD use/VB a/DT combination/NN of/IN tariffs/NNS and/CC quotas/NNS to/TO cushion/VB their/PRP$ farmers/NNS from/IN foreign/JJ competition/NN ./.
It/PRP also/RB says/VBZ countries/NNS could/MD temporarily/RB raise/VB tariffs/NNS on/IN certain/JJ products/NNS if/IN they/PRP experience/VBP an/DT unusually/RB heavy/JJ volume/NN of/IN imports/NNS ./.
Instead/RB of/IN proposing/VBG a/DT complete/JJ elimination/NN of/IN farm/NN subsidies/NNS ,/, as/IN the/DT earlier/JJR U.S./NNP proposal/NN did/VBD ,/, the/DT new/JJ package/NN calls/VBZ for/IN the/DT elimination/NN of/IN only/RB the/DT most/JJS tradedistorting/JJ ones/NNS ./.
Less/RBR objectionable/JJ ones/NNS would/MD be/VB subject/JJ only/RB to/TO some/DT restraints/NNS ,/, and/CC others/NNS with/IN a/DT ``/`` relatively/RB minor/JJ trade/NN impact/NN ''/'' would/MD be/VB allowed/VBN to/TO continue/VB under/IN certain/JJ conditions/NNS ./.
The/DT new/JJ U.S./NNP plan/NN also/RB would/MD establish/VB procedures/NNS to/TO prevent/VB countries/NNS from/IN using/VBG health/NN and/CC sanitation/NN rules/NNS to/TO impede/VB trade/NN arbitrarily/RB ./.
The/DT goal/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO resolve/VB disputes/NNS such/JJ as/IN one/CD prompted/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Community/NNP 's/POS current/JJ attempt/NN to/TO bar/NN imports/NNS of/IN beef/NN from/IN hormone-treated/JJ U.S./NNP cattle/NNS ./.
The/DT U.S./NNP contends/VBZ that/IN the/DT rules/NNS are/VBP n't/RB justified/VBN on/IN health/NN grounds/NNS ./.
To/TO encourage/VB more/JJR competition/NN among/IN exporting/VBG countries/NNS ,/, the/DT U.S./NNP is/VBZ proposing/VBG that/IN export/NN subsidies/NNS ,/, including/VBG tax/NN incentives/NNS for/IN exporters/NNS ,/, be/VB phased/VBN out/RP in/IN five/CD years/NNS ./.
