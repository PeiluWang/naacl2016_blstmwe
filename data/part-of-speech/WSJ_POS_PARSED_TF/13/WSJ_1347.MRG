Neither/DT suit/NN lists/VBZ specific/JJ dollar/NN claims/NNS ,/, largely/RB because/IN damage/NN assessment/NN has/VBZ n't/RB yet/RB been/VBN completed/VBN ./.
Legal/JJ strategists/NNS say/VBP that/IN damage/NN claims/NNS against/IN the/DT oil/NN giant/NN and/CC others/NNS could/MD well/RB exceed/VB $/$ #/CD billion/CD ./.
Litigation/NN ,/, if/IN not/RB settled/VBN out/IN of/IN court/NN ,/, could/MD drag/VB on/RP for/IN years/NNS ./.
Exxon/NNP said/VBD in/IN its/PRP$ suit/NN that/IN it/PRP will/MD seek/VB reimbursement/NN from/IN the/DT state/NN for/IN that/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT cleanup/NN costs/NNS and/CC damage/NN claims/NNS it/PRP says/VBZ resulted/VBD from/IN the/DT state/NN 's/POS conduct/NN ./.
The/DT oil/NN company/NN claims/VBZ that/IN Alaskan/JJ officials/NNS prevented/VBD Exxon/NNP from/IN spraying/VBG dispersant/NN onto/IN the/DT almost/RB #/CD million/CD gallons/NNS of/IN oil/NN dumped/VBN when/WRB one/CD of/IN its/PRP$ tankers/NNS ran/VBD into/IN an/DT underwater/JJ reef/NN ./.

Exxon/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN them/PRP before/RB ,/, at/IN which/WDT point/NN the/DT state/NN demonstrated/VBD they/PRP were/VBD untrue/JJ ./.
The/DT state/NN will/MD vigorously/RB defend/VB against/IN any/DT counterclaim/NN ./. ''/''
Since/IN the/DT spill/NN last/JJ March/NNP ,/, Exxon/NNP and/CC the/DT state/NN have/VBP been/VBN wrangling/VBG over/IN whether/IN spraying/VBG dispersant/NN on/IN the/DT oil/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ hours/NNS after/IN the/DT spill/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT weather/NN was/VBD clear/JJ and/CC calm/JJ ,/, would/MD have/VB helped/VBN limit/VB the/DT environmental/JJ damage/NN ./.
Exxon/NNP claims/VBZ that/IN use/NN of/IN dispersants/NNS ,/, which/WDT break/VBP an/DT oil/NN slick/NN into/IN microscopic/JJ droplets/NNS ,/, was/VBD a/DT crucial/JJ part/NN of/IN its/PRP$ immediate-response/JJ plan/NN and/CC that/IN state/NN officials/NNS banned/VBD their/PRP$ use/NN during/IN the/DT two/CD days/NNS of/IN fair/JJ weather/NN following/VBG the/DT spill/NN ./.
The/DT oil/NN company/NN claims/VBZ that/IN it/PRP had/VBD permission/NN from/IN the/DT U.S./NNP Environmental/NNP Protection/NNP Agency/NNP prior/RB to/TO the/DT spill/NN to/TO use/VB dispersant/NN during/IN such/PDT an/DT incident/NN at/IN the/DT discretion/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP Coast/NNP Guard/NNP ./.
The/DT state/NN 's/POS opposition/NN to/TO the/DT use/NN of/IN dispersants/NNS ,/, Exxon/NNP says/VBZ ,/, caused/VBD the/DT Coast/NNP Guard/NNP ``/`` to/TO delay/VB granting/VBG permission/NN ./. ''/''
Alaskan/JJ and/CC Coast/NNP Guard/NNP officials/NNS say/VBP Exxon/NNP 's/POS charges/NNS are/VBP n't/RB relevant/JJ because/IN tests/NNS conducted/VBN during/IN the/DT first/JJ two/CD days/NNS following/VBG the/DT spill/NN showed/VBD that/IN the/DT dispersant/NN was/VBD n't/RB working/VBG anyway/RB ./.
