Yoshitoki/NNP Chino/NNP retains/VBZ his/PRP$ title/NN of/IN chairman/NN of/IN Daiwa/NNP ,/, Japan/NNP 's/POS second-largest/JJ securities/NNS firm/NN ./.
In/IN Japanese/JJ firms/NNS ,/, the/DT president/NN usually/RB is/VBZ in/IN charge/NN of/IN day-to-day/JJ operations/NNS ,/, while/IN the/DT chairman/NN 's/POS role/NN is/VBZ more/RBR a/DT ceremonial/JJ one/NN ./.
The/DT title/NN of/IN chief/JJ executive/JJ officer/NN is/VBZ n't/RB used/VBN ./.
While/IN people/NNS within/IN Daiwa/NNP ,/, particularly/RB internationalists/NNS ,/, expected/VBD that/IN Mr./NNP Dozen/NNP ,/, #/CD ,/, would/MD eventually/RB become/VB Daiwa/NNP 's/POS president/NN ,/, the/DT speed/NN of/IN his/PRP$ promotion/NN surprised/VBD many/JJ ./.
It/PRP was/VBD only/RB earlier/RBR this/DT year/NN that/IN the/DT jovial/JJ ,/, easygoing/JJ executive/NN --/: he/PRP likes/VBZ to/TO joke/VB with/IN Americans/NNPS about/IN how/WRB his/PRP$ name/NN is/VBZ synonymous/JJ with/IN twelve/CD --/: was/VBD appointed/VBN deputy/JJ president/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Dozen/NNP is/VBZ taking/VBG over/RP the/DT reins/NNS of/IN a/DT securities/NNS company/NN that/WDT does/VBZ very/RB well/RB in/IN its/PRP$ domestic/JJ market/NN but/CC that/DT is/VBZ still/RB seeking/VBG to/TO realize/VB its/PRP$ potential/NN in/IN global/JJ investment/NN banking/NN and/CC securities/NNS dealing/NN ./.
Daiwa/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT world/NN 's/POS largest/JJS securities/NNS firms/NNS ./.

Both/DT figures/NNS were/VBD record/JJ highs/NNS ./.
Several/JJ observers/NNS interpreted/VBD Mr./NNP Dozen/NNP 's/POS appointment/NN as/IN an/DT attempt/NN by/IN Daiwa/NNP to/TO make/VB its/PRP$ international/JJ operations/NNS more/RBR profitable/JJ while/IN preparing/VBG the/DT firm/NN for/IN the/DT effects/NNS of/IN the/DT continuing/JJ deregulation/NN of/IN Japan/NNP 's/POS domestic/JJ markets/NNS ,/, which/WDT should/MD mean/VB increased/JJ competition/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, Daiwa/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ brethren/NNS have/VBP faced/VBN stiff/JJ competition/NN from/IN well-entrenched/JJ American/JJ competitors/NNS that/WDT have/VBP prevented/VBN them/PRP from/IN building/VBG strong/JJ links/NNS to/TO U.S./NNP corporations/NNS and/CC institutional/JJ investors/NNS ./.
