You/PRP 'd/MD think/VB all/PDT the/DT stories/NNS about/IN well-heeled/JJ communities/NNS and/CC developers/NNS getting/VBG HUD/NNP grants/NNS would/MD prompt/VB Congress/NNP to/TO tighten/VB up/RP on/IN upscale/JJ housing/NN subsidies/NNS ./.
No/DT way/NN ./.
Congress/NNP has/VBZ just/RB made/VBN it/PRP easier/JJR for/IN the/DT affluent/JJ to/TO qualify/VB for/IN insured/JJ loans/NNS from/IN the/DT deficit-ridden/JJ Federal/NNP Housing/NNP Administration/NNP ./.
It/PRP appears/VBZ that/IN the/DT only/JJ thing/NN Congress/NNP is/VBZ learning/VBG from/IN the/DT HUD/NNP story/NN is/VBZ how/WRB to/TO enlarge/VB its/PRP$ control/NN of/IN the/DT honey/NN pot/NN going/VBG to/TO special/JJ interests/NNS ./.
Right/RB now/RB ,/, the/DT largest/JJS loan/NN the/DT FHA/NNP can/MD insure/VB in/IN high-cost/JJ housing/NN markets/NNS is/VBZ $/$ #,#/CD ./.
Last/JJ week/NN ,/, housing/NN lobbies/NNS persuaded/VBD Congress/NNP to/TO raise/VB the/DT ceiling/NN to/TO $/$ #,#/CD ,/, making/VBG FHA/NNP loans/NNS more/RBR accessible/JJ to/TO the/DT well-to-do/JJ ./.
But/CC it/PRP does/VBZ that/DT at/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN deepening/VBG the/DT taxpayer/NN 's/POS exposure/NN if/IN the/DT FHA/NNP is/VBZ forced/VBN to/TO pay/VB for/IN more/JJR loans/NNS going/VBG sour/JJ ./.
This/DT is/VBZ no/DT idle/JJ fear/NN last/JJ year/NN the/DT FHA/NNP lost/VBD $/$ #.#/CD billion/CD in/IN loan/NN defaults/NNS ./.
But/CC the/DT higher/JJR mortgage/NN ceiling/NN is/VBZ only/RB the/DT starter/JJ kit/NN for/IN what/WP Senator/NNP Alan/NNP Cranston/NNP and/CC Majority/NNP Leader/NNP George/NNP Mitchell/NNP have/VBP in/IN mind/NN for/IN housing/NN ./.
The/DT Senate/NNP Banking/NNP Committee/NNP will/MD begin/VB hearings/NNS next/IN week/NN on/IN their/PRP$ proposal/NN to/TO expand/VB existing/VBG federal/JJ housing/NN programs/NNS ./.
Other/JJ Senators/NNP want/VBP to/TO lower/VB the/DT down/JJ payments/NNS required/VBN on/IN FHA-insured/JJ loans/NNS ./.
That/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT formula/NN for/IN ensuring/VBG even/RB more/JJR FHA/NNP red/JJ ink/NN ./.
Experience/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ element/NN in/IN predicting/VBG a/DT housing-loan/NN default/NN is/VBZ the/DT down/JJ payment/NN ./.
Because/IN a/DT purchaser/NN can/MD use/VB an/DT FHA/NNP loan/NN to/TO finance/VB all/DT points/NNS and/CC closing/NN costs/NNS ,/, the/DT FHA/NNP can/MD wind/VB up/RP lending/VBG more/JJR than/IN a/DT house/NN is/VBZ worth/IN ./.
If/IN housing/NN prices/NNS continue/VBP to/TO fall/VB ,/, many/JJ borrowers/NNS would/MD be/VB better/JJR off/RP walking/VBG away/RB from/IN their/PRP$ homes/NNS and/CC leaving/VBG taxpayers/NNS with/IN the/DT losses/NNS ./.
Much/RB the/DT same/JJ thing/NN happened/VBD with/IN busted/JJ S&Ls/NNS ,/, a/DT problem/NN Congress/NNP just/RB ``/`` solved/VBD ''/'' with/IN a/DT $/$ #/CD billion/CD bailout/NN ./.
We/PRP hear/VBP that/IN HUD/NNP Secretary/NNP Jack/NNP Kemp/NNP is/VBZ toying/VBG with/IN going/VBG along/RP with/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT Cranston-Mitchell/NNP proposals/NNS ./.
That/DT sounds/VBZ like/IN a/DT formula/NN for/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN he/PRP gets/VBZ dragged/VBN into/IN the/DT next/JJ HUD/NNP tar/NN pit/NN ./.
A/DT group/NN of/IN #/CD Senators/NNPS has/VBZ written/VBN Mr./NNP Kemp/NNP urging/VBG him/PRP to/TO reject/VB Cranston-Mitchell/NNP and/CC focus/VB on/IN programs/NNS that/WDT empower/VBP the/DT poor/JJ rather/RB than/IN create/VB vast/JJ new/JJ government/NN obligations/NNS ./.
But/CC even/RB if/IN he/PRP agrees/VBZ ,/, Mr./NNP Kemp/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB write/VB the/DT nation/NN 's/POS housing/NN law/NN --/: Congress/NNP does/VBZ ./.
And/CC the/DT majority/NN of/IN Members/NNS cynically/RB view/VBP the/DT current/JJ discrediting/NN of/IN HUD/NNP as/IN mainly/RB a/DT chance/NN to/TO shove/VB through/RP their/PRP$ own/JJ slate/NN of/IN projects/NNS ./.
Exhibit/NN A/NN is/VBZ last/JJ week/NN 's/POS House/NNP vote/NN to/TO fund/VB #/CD pet/JJ projects/NNS out/IN of/IN the/DT same/JJ discretionary/JJ fund/NN that/WDT is/VBZ at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT HUD/NNP scandal/NN ./.
None/NN of/IN the/DT grants/NNS had/VBD been/VBN requested/VBN by/IN HUD/NNP ,/, judged/VBN competitively/RB or/CC were/VBD the/DT subject/NN of/IN a/DT single/JJ hearing/NN ./.
More/JJR and/CC more/JJR observers/NNS now/RB realize/VBP that/IN the/DT key/NN to/TO ending/VBG future/JJ HUD/NNP scandals/NNS lies/VBZ in/IN forcing/VBG Congress/NNP to/TO clean/VB up/RP its/PRP$ own/JJ act/NN ./.
This/DT week/NN ,/, a/DT Baltimore/NNP Sun/NNP editorial/NN said/VBD the/DT Lantos/NNP subcommittee/NN on/IN HUD/NNP should/MD forget/VB about/IN Sam/NNP Pierce/NNP 's/POS testimony/NN for/IN the/DT moment/NN and/CC call/VB some/DT other/JJ witnesses/NNS :/: the/DT various/JJ congressional/JJ sponsors/NNS of/IN the/DT #/CD pork-barrel/JJ projects/NNS ./.
The/DT Sun/NNP concluded/VBD that/IN Mr./NNP Pierce/NNP is/VBZ only/RB part/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN --/: and/CC a/DT part/NN that/WDT 's/VBZ gone/VBN ./.
``/`` If/IN HUD/NNP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB reformed/VBN ,/, ''/'' it/PRP concluded/VBD ,/, Members/NNPS of/IN Congress/NNP will/MD ``/`` have/VB to/TO start/VB looking/VBG into/IN ,/, and/CC doing/VBG something/NN about/IN ,/, the/DT practices/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ colleagues/NNS ./. ''/''
Of/IN course/NN ,/, self-reform/NN is/VBZ about/RB the/DT last/JJ thing/NN this/DT Congress/NNP is/VBZ interested/JJ in/IN ./.
Proponents/NNS of/IN expanding/VBG FHA/NNP programs/NNS say/VBP they/PRP merely/RB want/VBP to/TO help/VB home/NN buyers/NNS who/WP are/VBP frozen/VBN out/IN of/IN high-priced/JJ markets/NNS ./.
But/CC the/DT FHA/NNP program/NN is/VBZ hemorrhaging/VBG bad/JJ loans/NNS ./.
Jack/NNP Kemp/NNP has/VBZ submitted/VBN a/DT package/NN of/IN reforms/NNS ,/, and/CC they/PRP are/VBP surely/RB headed/VBN for/IN the/DT Capitol/NNP Hill/NNP sausage-grinder/NN ./.
Like/IN the/DT S&L/NNP mess/NN before/IN it/PRP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT problem/NN Congress/NNP should/MD be/VB solving/VBG ,/, not/RB ignoring/VBG ./.
